Hi there! My name is Kris Brandow, but around most of the internet I'm skriptble.

I'm a Drupal & Web Developer for Columbia University Medical College and I love
building stuff using web technologies. I mainly develop in PHP, but I also use a
bunch of other web technologies like Javascript, MySQL, MongoDB, Drupal,
Node.js, HTMl, and CSS. I primarily do backend development but you might catch
me doing some front end development and design here and there.

I develop in VIM, some people love IDEs and some love text editors. I love VIM.
It gives me a ton of flexibility, comes with almost any linux distro, and with a
little configuration is becomes extremely powerful. That said, when I'm not
doing something on the command line (like the unfortunate occasions when I am
forced to use SFTP) I also use MacVim or TextWrangler.

I throughly enjoy learning and reading. If you see me on the subway, I'll
probably have some headphones in either listening to a podcast or reading a
book. My fascination jumps around, sometimes I'll spend a couple weeks learning
about different databases and sometimes it'll be programming languages. There
are even times when I get into reading development theory or some system
administration stuff. It's usually a toss up.

I'm a writer (it's what my college degree is in). I mostly write fiction, but I
also know how to write screenplays and stage plays. Obviously I write code, and
I try hard to ensure my code is either throughly commented or straight forward
enough to understand from reading it. After all, I don't write a story to
explain what's happening in my story.
