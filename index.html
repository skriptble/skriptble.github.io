    <p>One of the difficult things about the software engineering world and
especially of the web development world is trying to gage the value of a
developer. We can&#8217;t be simply asked questions about our work, because it isn&#8217;t
difficult to fake knowledge. We could check out people&#8217;s Github accounts, but
that only works if the developer is able to work on work outside of work, or
works at a company that allows work to be open sourced. The default is usually
using methods like what degrees someone holds, how many years they&#8217;ve be
developing, and other such arbitrary measures that don&#8217;t actually gage what a
developers abilities or value.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been reading quite a bit about hypermedia APIs, the support for them,
and the arguments against them. I find the arguments against them
perplexing actually, seeing as the thing they argue against is the same system
that allowed their readers to actually find their argument. I&#8217;m not surprised
though, we&#8217;ve had this issue for a while in the technology industry. Every time
we come up with a new technology, we define it by the paradigms of what it is
supposedly replacing. Instead of seeing architecture of web APIs as an extension
of the web, we see them as extension of the internal systems programming we&#8217;ve
been doing for quite a while. We are used to directly calling out a specific
resource, and bundling resources together into packages. This isn&#8217;t how the web
works, so trying to build systems that don&#8217;t utilize the web&#8217;s strength aren&#8217;t
going to get the best results.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve had many mentors over the past several years of my life. There is always
this feeling that one&#8217;s mentor knows all about the subject they mentor in. It&#8217;s
as if they have been given the great knowledge of everything. I&#8217;ve recently been
kicked out of this mirage though. I&#8217;ve started encountering areas where even the
people I consider my mentors and those I think highly of are wrong or not
forward thinking about for my tastes.</p>

  <section>
    <p>A couple weeks ago I wrote a post about how important planning is. I wrote about
the importance of writing things down and having the ability to switch gears.
Since this blog is evolving as I do, it&#8217;s apt that I write about how my views on
this subject has changed.</p>
