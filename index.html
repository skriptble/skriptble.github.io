    Hi there! This is my website and blog, and it's a work in progress.<br>
    You can find my resume here as well as some blog posts. They're mostly in draft form right now, but I felt it was a good idea to share my throughts with the world. If you have any comments feel free to email me. I'll eventually get something like Disqus up and running too (hopefully). Enjoy!

    <p>Forward thinking is important. Lack of forward thinking can run a
project or a team into a dark place that&#8217;s not easy to get out of. As with
everything there is a flipside of that, which is the pitfall I usually find
myself in. That pitfall is thinking too far ahead.</p>

    <p>Today I was fixing a problem at work with one of the sites I&#8217;m the lead
developer on. The problem was a small and unfortunate QA error from a previous
release of the site. While I was preparing to send out an email to some other
team members to QA the site again I realized the only documentation of the
problem was scattered in emails and conversations. I thought I should perhaps
make a entry in the wiki. After a few moments of thinking, I came up with a
better solution.</p>

    <p>Initial perfection isn&#8217;t possible. The launch day is not the day an application
or website will be perfected. This is why building minimum viable products
and take smaller steps makes sense. Shipping is the most important thing,
because the best product in the world won&#8217;t matter if it never sees the light of
day.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a goal driven individual. Without goals I often find myself drifting into
strange places that are usually unproductive and lead to a state of complacency.
Setting insane goals is an awesome way to push myself to the edge, so I&#8217;ve
decided to set one. I want to learn 6 core languages.</p>
