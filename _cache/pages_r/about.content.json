{"parts":[{"content":"Hi there! My name is Kris Brandow, but around most of the internet I'm skriptble.\n\nI'm a Drupal & Web Developer for Columbia University Medical College and I love\nbuilding stuff using web technologies. I mainly develop in PHP, but I also use a\nbunch of other web technologies like Javascript, MySQL, MongoDB, Drupal,\nNode.js, HTMl, and CSS. I primarily do backend development but you might catch\nme doing some front end development and design here and there.\n\nI develop in VIM, some people love IDEs and some love text editors. I love VIM.\nIt gives me a ton of flexibility, comes with almost any linux distro, and with a\nlittle configuration is becomes extremely powerful. That said, when I'm not\ndoing something on the command line (like the unfortunate occasions when I am\nforced to use SFTP) I also use MacVim or TextWrangler.\n\nI throughly enjoy learning and reading. If you see me on the subway, I'll\nprobably have some headphones in either listening to a podcast or reading a\nbook. My fascination jumps around, sometimes I'll spend a couple weeks learning\nabout different databases and sometimes it'll be programming languages. There\nare even times when I get into reading development theory or some system\nadministration stuff. It's usually a toss up.\n\nI'm a writer (it's what my college degree is in). I mostly write fiction, but I\nalso know how to write screenplays and stage plays. Obviously I write code, and\nI try hard to ensure my code is either throughly commented or straight forward\nenough to understand from reading it. After all, I don't write a story to\nexplain what's happening in my story.\n\nBelow is a list of technologies I use or am learning to use:\n\n- Drupal\n- PHP\n- MySQL\n- Apache\n- NGinx\n- MongoDB\n- Redis\n- Javascript\n- jQuery\n- Node.js\n- Memcached\n- HTML\n- CSS\n- VIM\n- Mac OS X\n- Ubuntu\n- Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n- Nagios\n- Munin\n- Varnish\n- Wordpress\n","format":null}]}
