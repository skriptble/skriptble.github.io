    <p>I have a Barnes and Noble membership and every so often I get these nifty
coupons that give me an extra 20% off. I didn&#8217;t use these for the first few
months I got them, but then I realized how important learning is to my career
and decided that every time I got a coupon I would go buy a book. A few days ago
I got one of those coupons, and today I decided to pick up a book that I&#8217;ve been
eyeing for a while on a topic I&#8217;ve been eyeing for a while: <a href="http://www.manning.com/pharrington/">Machine
Learning</a></p>

    <p>There are a large number of professions out there where you have to practice
before you can perform. Musicians do it, as do artists, writers, and chefs. You
wouldn&#8217;t be too happy if a chef decided to try out a new recipe for your meal
and they had never cooked it before. A writer wouldn&#8217;t hand the first copy of a
screen play or manuscript to a publisher or a studio. Artists certain draw,
paint, or sculpt more than once before they create their final product for
showing. Musicians practice for years, they don&#8217;t get up on stage in a symphony
having never played their music before. These professions pay varying amounts of
money, but software development makes more than several of these. Why is it
okay, in our industry, to not practice?</p>

    <p>Content is the most important thing on the web. Without it, all the javascript,
css, and shiny wouldn&#8217;t mean a thing. It doesn&#8217;t matter what backend system you
use, whether it&#8217;s PHP, Java, .NET, Ruby, Python, or Node.js. Without content,
they have nothing to serve. The storage of this content is just as important as
the content itself, so perhaps it&#8217;s time to come up with a new method for
storing it.</p>
