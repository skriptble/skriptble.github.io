  <p>I&#8217;ve been reading quite a bit about hypermedia APIs, the support for them,
and the arguments against them. I find the arguments against them
perplexing actually, seeing as the thing they argue against is the same system
that allowed their readers to actually find their argument. I&#8217;m not surprised
though, we&#8217;ve had this issue for a while in the technology industry. Every time
we come up with a new technology, we define it by the paradigms of what it is
supposedly replacing. Instead of seeing architecture of web APIs as an extension
of the web, we see them as extension of the internal systems programming we&#8217;ve
been doing for quite a while. We are used to directly calling out a specific
resource, and bundling resources together into packages. This isn&#8217;t how the web
works, so trying to build systems that don&#8217;t utilize the web&#8217;s strength aren&#8217;t
going to get the best results.</p>

<h2>Fighting Is Difficult</h2>

<p>Change does not come easy, especially when there is pride involved and people
decidedly do things because that&#8217;s the only way they&#8217;ve known. I&#8217;ve experienced
these types of things and have talked about it through various blog posts, but
the worst side effect I&#8217;ve noticed is that the more &#8220;standard&#8221; the thing you&#8217;re
trying to change, the more ridiculous backlash you&#8217;ll get. Hypermedia being used
to power an application isn&#8217;t some ridiculous statement. The arguments against
using hypermedia for an API don&#8217;t hold water. Mainly because the web itself is
an API.</p>

<p>Disagree? Some might say &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s an API that&#8217;s only interfaced by humans&#8221;.
This isn&#8217;t true at all. If that was true, the web would be much more difficult
to use. When you look at it, Google is the API client of the World Wide Web.
Obviously, Bing, Yahoo, and the other search engines are as well. Google isn&#8217;t
written for a specific website, there aren&#8217;t different versions of Google for
different websites. Google doesn&#8217;t need a custom client to pull data from
Facebook or Twitter. The API client you&#8217;re using to read this blog post doesn&#8217;t
either. Navigating to this website isn&#8217;t a singular interaction between you and
the server. The browser client received the information from the server and did
several more requests to load all the resources and display the final page to
you. Facebook&#8217;s API, Twitter&#8217;s API, Google&#8217;s API, every API I&#8217;ve ever seen
doesn&#8217;t follow this. I need a special client, written by that specific company,
that specifically talks to their API.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve built it wrong. Google did it right at first, because that&#8217;s the only way
they could do it. Now things are wrong. They build their API&#8217;s so their own
search engine API couldn&#8217;t crawl it<sup>1</sup>. The reason we did this is
obvious: We didn&#8217;t want to change the way we built applications, nor did we have
the server performance necessary for this to be accomplished. We have the
possibility of server performance that can handle the amount of traffic
necessary to make hypermedia APIs a reality. Now we just have to start building
our applications in the same way we built the web.</p>

<p>On the web, things are much more flexible, redundant, and fault tolerant. Take
DNS for example. If the main DNS servers that hold the master records broke, the
entire internet doesn&#8217;t go down. That&#8217;s because DNS was built so that in order
to be completely down, every DNS server in existence would have to go down. That
isn&#8217;t going to happen<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p><small>1: Okay so this might not actually be true, but you get the
points.</small></p>

<p><small>2: Also not entirely true, large chunks of the internet could disappear
if this happened.</small></p>
