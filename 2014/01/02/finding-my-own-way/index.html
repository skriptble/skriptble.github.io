  <p>It&#8217;s a new year. I&#8217;ve spent time evolving the ways I view important
points in time, removing the need to celebrate arbitrary divisions of
time. There shouldn&#8217;t be a reason to celebrate, celebrations should occur
whenever the inspiration strikes. I have to say I&#8217;ve noticed a distinct
evolution in myself during this particular arbitrary division of time though.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I&#8217;ve been lost for a while and confused on what I want to do with my
life. I&#8217;ve evolved and made it through a whole bunch of nonsense over the past
year and three quarters. Gradating college was a scary thing for me. I wasn&#8217;t
sure if I would be able to make it in the world as a web developer with no
formal training. I was worried that all that I thought my life could become was
just a lie I told myself. It&#8217;s been difficult. I found my first job, which
turned out to be awful, and now I have a job but constant conflicts have made me
wonder if I&#8217;m just letting myself get comfortable because I&#8217;m scared.</p>

<p>Despite the drama of my personal life between bad roommate situations,
ridiculous rent prices, and the constant pain of unlearning so much of what I&#8217;ve
been taught over the years about life, I still surprise myself everyday when I
wake up and go to work. I&#8217;m defying so much of what I learned about how to be
successful. I&#8217;m scared, mostly because I&#8217;ve always had the shelter of a mentor
or a role model to guide me through all the problems I encounter. Now I just
don&#8217;t have that. I don&#8217;t even have a guiding light to point me in the right
direction. Two decades of education has left me feeling lost when there isn&#8217;t
someone there to point me in the right direction. That leaves me with the
question of what do I do now? How do I find my way on my own?</p>

<p>Aside from writing, the other thing that has helped me evolve is being
spontaneous with decisions. College had a lot of those for me. Between joining
the television station and then the student government, even if my initial
reasons for pursuing those things weren&#8217;t pure the outcome certainly was. Many
of decisions made once I was in those organizations were spontaneous. Certainly
some of the best were completely spontaneous, but often they were dragged on for
too long before a decision was actually executed.</p>

<p>Part of me feels like this is what&#8217;s happening to me right now. I can&#8217;t say I
don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m suffocating at work. There are so many problems that I just
keep asking myself &#8220;Why?&#8221;. Why are we attempting to solve this problem in this
way. Why is everything a comparison to what someone else has? Why are we always
trying to give the clients what they want. What they think they want. There are
many things I&#8217;ve learned from observing the technological evolutions of the past
years, and the most glaring one is that it is rare that the user of a particular
technology actually knows they want it before it&#8217;s handed to them. They think
they know what they want, but usually they are constrained by what exists, even
if it isn&#8217;t nearly the fit that&#8217;s needed. That is certainly part of the place
that my strong feels are stemming from. Instead of building something to solve
the problems, we&#8217;re building something that compares to the other things that
sort of solve the problems. We are obsessed with attempting to pull more people
into our system that doesn&#8217;t exist yet, even though we are already far beyond
capacity. It seems the hope is that once we have everyone on board that we will
finally be able to build the thing that we wish to have.</p>

<p>The problem with that logic is it skips the largest problem of all: we already
have stuff. That stuff isn&#8217;t that the best, but it&#8217;s there and it can&#8217;t be
ignored. There are a bunch of sites that are sitting on their own, instead of
building a solution that pulls various aspects of each of those together into
individual services, we are attempting to build a new solution and simply push
everything into it.</p>

<p>The worst thing of it is I don&#8217;t even feel like speaking up about it anymore.
I&#8217;ve spent to much time trying to make things work, only to be shot down and
shoved to the side. I&#8217;ve decided that my knowledge and opinion are only useful
when technical details are discussed. There is a vision of how to build
something and accomplish the tasks laid out. Which is fine, but that vision has
been tried by many others and while their success is varying, it hardly reaches
the level of being the solution that the users didn&#8217;t know they wanted. One of
my good friends told me I should hightail it out of my current job and find
another place where I can breathe again. I have certainly become complacent
again, and what&#8217;s worse is now I&#8217;m starting to wonder if anyone else will want
to take me. That&#8217;s obviously silly because I know my skills are well sought
after. Its difficult when the environment around serves to squash my drive to
accomplish great things. I constantly hear the opinions of a group of people who
clearly do not understand how the world is actually changed or evolved. It&#8217;s the
line of how the average place works, the average business, the average company,
the standard. I&#8217;ve never been the average, and I certainly won&#8217;t be once I&#8217;m on
my own.</p>

<p>The loudest line I hear is that I&#8217;ll have to work with difficult people. I do
not think they have the understanding that to do great things, you cannot work
with others who do not aspire to do great things. Great minds work together.
They certainly don&#8217;t deal with nonsense of bad attitudes or stupidity. If you
can&#8217;t swim on your own, don&#8217;t get in the water. Right now, I&#8217;m the long distance
competitive swimmer training to swim with the best of them and win a few events.
The people I work with? They&#8217;re in the shallow end, standing with floaties on. I
need a change. This isn&#8217;t the environment for me.</p>
