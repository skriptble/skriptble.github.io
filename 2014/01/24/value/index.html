  <p>One of the difficult things about the software engineering world and
especially of the web development world is trying to gage the value of a
developer. We can&#8217;t be simply asked questions about our work, because it isn&#8217;t
difficult to fake knowledge. We could check out people&#8217;s Github accounts, but
that only works if the developer is able to work on work outside of work, or
works at a company that allows work to be open sourced. The default is usually
using methods like what degrees someone holds, how many years they&#8217;ve be
developing, and other such arbitrary measures that don&#8217;t actually gage what a
developers abilities or value.</p>

<p>As a young developer I feel as if I&#8217;ve encountered this problem. I&#8217;m only on my
second year of &#8220;professional&#8221; development work. In reality I&#8217;m on my third
because the work I did in college was just as professional as the work I&#8217;m doing
now. In some ways it was more professional. Years are a bad judge because people
can simply repeat their first two years of experience four times and claim 8
years of experience. That&#8217;s like a car company saying they&#8217;ve designed 200
million cars because they took 2 design and created 100 million cars from each.</p>

<p>Degrees offer value, the problem is education isn&#8217;t a practical form of skill
training. This is a general misunderstanding of what education is. There is a
thought that college is a way to prepare an individual for real life and a
professional career. If this were true, we&#8217;d be sending plumbers and
electricians to college and not trade school. I have a degree in English and
Communication, but that didn&#8217;t teach me how to be a writer. I learned how to
write from practical experience.</p>

<p>The web development industry needs to get a bit smarter with hiring practices.
Companies should stop worrying about how flashy something is and start thinking
big picture. A team of autodidacts and continual learners will provide not only
higher quality work, but their work will also evolve over time. I don&#8217;t think a
person can truly be an autodidact or consume knowledge without being able to
evolve. Being a writer helps me write strong code, albeit sometimes messy code.
As writers we never feel our work is finished, a story is never complete, a
novel never finished, but we have to publish. Code to me is never complete. A
project is never done. We ship a version but that isn&#8217;t a &#8220;we&#8217;re done&#8221;, it&#8217;s
just another step along the path. I think that&#8217;s what makes me different than
most developers. I&#8217;m not married to my code, it isn&#8217;t a representation of me now
it&#8217;s a representation of a particular set of circumstances.</p>

<p>That said, if I build something completely awful that is a reflection on me. If
I do it three times over, I should probably attempt to enhance my development
skills. I shouldn&#8217;t put the work up as my pride and joy. I&#8217;ve written some
pretty awful stories and I&#8217;ve written some pretty awful code. I look back on my
first web application, my first large scale Drupal module, and my first large
Drupal applications. They aren&#8217;t pretty, I would have built them very
differently now. That happens though. That&#8217;s part of the growth process.</p>
