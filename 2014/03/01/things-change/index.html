  <p>I officially had my last day at my now previous job a couple days ago. It feels
a bit strange switching gears, after all I worked there for over a year. To most
that doesn&#8217;t seem like long, but when you&#8217;re this early in your career, that is
the longest amount of time I&#8217;ve held a job.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I&#8217;m glad I made the change though, honestly it was time for me to take the next
step. I needed a change of environment and I never actually wanted to be the
in-house expert on anything, much less most technical things. I need a place
where I can flourish, and my previous job wasn&#8217;t it. I am excited to be in a
more challenging environment, but what I&#8217;m starting to realize is that perhaps
the 9-5 mentality isn&#8217;t quite for me. Lucky, this job isn&#8217;t the 9-5 type, it&#8217;s
more flexible than that, but not quite as flexible as if I was building my own
products and working on a schedule that I make up entirely on my own.</p>

<p>That is a way off though. Right now I need to focus on building my skills up,
which the focus on this new job will allow me to do since it is entirely Drupal.
Sometimes having too much flexibility is more of a curse than a gift. Where I am
as far as my development career right now is all over, I want to learn
everything and try everything, and I need to do that in a sandboxed place. I
need to do that where I can, at least for the beginning, play by my own rules
and craft applications that I can switch major parts out in the middle of
development. If I start with Mongo, I want to be able to switch to Redis on the
drop of a hat. That&#8217;s how I learn, thrown into the craziness of active
development.</p>

<p>Ultimately, what I&#8217;m learning from this is that things do in fact change. Life
doesn&#8217;t stand still, even when you try to make it. Life is going to keep moving,
and it&#8217;s up to each of us individually to decide if we want to standstill or
move along with life. Stagnation is an option, and while you can get along with
being complacent, where&#8217;s the fun in that? Code should be simple, clean, and
well documented. The ideas we craft into applications aren&#8217;t subject to the same
standards, on the contrary, they should be complex and life changing.</p>
