  <p>Things have changed quite a bit for me in the past few weeks. I am leaving my
current job at Columbia, and joining another team. This is definitely a step up
in my career. This is definitely getting me back on track.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I realized something was wrong a few weeks ago. I had a huge apartment situation
that made me start to evaluate my life as a whole. Looking back I&#8217;d realized I
had stopped writing, not just my blog but code as well. I had stagnated, leaving
me in a not so desirable situation. It was like the rebound period after an
actual breakup, except my breakup was with Drupal. The new job is in Drupal
though, so we&#8217;re still good friends. I&#8217;m actually excited to still be working
with Drupal, because this is going to be a more challenging environment and I&#8217;ll
be using Drupal in an entirely different way.</p>

<p>The explicit focus on Drupal at work means that I can use my time outside of
work to learn and being building a stronger skillset in my other core languages.
Over the past couple weeks I&#8217;ve begun to write programs with Go and I&#8217;ve picked
up an Erlang book that I&#8217;m enjoying. I feel like I&#8217;m actually learning the
language instead of learning how to write in the language. I&#8217;ve also started
reading the C book I bought a couple months back. Honestly, I&#8217;m not sure how
practical my Erlang and Go skills will be except to build my own applications
and services. It just doesn&#8217;t seem like an area that many people are hiring in
yet. I could be complete wrong though and my next step could be a position
working with Go all the time.</p>

<p>C is a safe bet though. Once I have a solid skillset programming in C I won&#8217;t
have any issue finding work. Then again, having a solid skillset in Drupal means
I won&#8217;t have any trouble finding work. I&#8217;ll also be focusing on HTML5 and
Javascript. I&#8217;ve been thinking lately about how HTML, CSS, and Javascript seem
to model MVC pretty well, I&#8217;d like to explore that idea more. In general I want
to bulk up on my Javascript skills so I can built clients for the various
services I&#8217;ll be building.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a few months too many since I&#8217;ve felt like this and actually taken
steps to accomplish it. I&#8217;m paying attention to my blog and website again and I
actually am starting to do work that I could feasibly post on here as tutorials.
I want to share my knowledge, as so many others have. This next step has made me
reflect on the way that I see myself and what my actual skills are versus how I
see my skills. I want to help more young developers find their way as I have,
because I&#8217;ve already experienced the struggle, it&#8217;d be nice to save someone else
the trouble if I can.</p>

<h3>Bittersweet</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve found there are a bunch of situations that are like roller coaster that
almost kill you: They start off not too scary, then they get to the height
horror where you think to yourself &#8216;I am never riding this thing again&#8217;, and by
the end so much has happened that you don&#8217;t want to get out of your seat. You
see ahead of you and the beginning looks wonderful.</p>

<p>The scary part is still there though. It hasn&#8217;t gone anywhere and if you ride
the roller coaster again the same thought will go through your head. For
roller coasters this is fine, they are generally safe and thrilling. Being on a
roller coaster at work is a bit different, but that&#8217;s every job. Any job that
doesn&#8217;t have ups and downs is boring. As I take my next step up I can&#8217;t help but
feel that bittersweet pull to ride this roller coaster just one more time,
hoping that the scary parts won&#8217;t be as scary and somehow there will be a
plethora of good parts that materialize from nowhere.</p>

<p>That won&#8217;t happen though. That can&#8217;t happen. So the best thing I can do is take
the next step and take everything I learned from here with me. There is an
entire amusement park out there, it would be a waste to only ride the same ride
fro the entire day, wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>
