  <p>I&#8217;m a goal driven individual. Without goals I often find myself drifting into
strange places that are usually unproductive and lead to a state of complacency.
Setting insane goals is an awesome way to push myself to the edge, so I&#8217;ve
decided to set one. I want to learn 6 core languages.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>On its face that doesn&#8217;t seem too hard. There are plenty of people out there who
become a polygot. It makes sense and most people probably should be a polygot.
Having more than one tool in your toolbag makes everything you build that much
better. Sure you can build things with only screws, but having a hammer and a
saw in there will make it easier.</p>

<h2>The Core</h2>

<p>The reason my goal is a touch insane is that I don&#8217;t want to learn closely
related languages. The languages I picked are a little all over the place. So
here&#8217;s the list: PHP, Javascript, Go, C, C++, Erlang. I&#8217;m cheating a little
because I already know a hefty amount of PHP and Javascript and I&#8217;m a novice C
and C++ guy. Other popular languages are missing like Java, Python, and Ruby.
I&#8217;m not saying I won&#8217;t learn those, but I don&#8217;t intend on having them be part of
my core.</p>

<p>The strangest one in this mix is definitely Go. It&#8217;s a modern language compared
to most others, it was built by some pretty brilliant guys, and it fascinates me.
I find python and ruby interesting, but Go has a different feel to it.</p>

<p>Second strangest is probably Erlang. When I decided I wanted to diversify my
language toolbox, I realized I should probably diversify the types of languages
as well. Erlang is a popular functional language, and I think it makes a useful
addition to my core.</p>

<p>C++ is the one language I&#8217;m not sure of, but I feel as if it goes along with C.
I might swap it out for a different language seeing as I have C for the low
level stuff and Go for the slightly higher level stuff (unless I&#8217;m
misunderstanding Go).</p>

<p>As I stated before this is my core, the languages I want to be able to wield at
a moments notice and be fluent in. I envision Python and Ruby, maybe even a
classic language like Smalltalk will be in my second tier of languages. Those
which I can read and write, but not at the same level as my core, although they
will most likely eventually move into the core as far as proficiency is
concerned. On the outer tiers I see languages like Java and C#. I&#8217;ll be able to
read and perhaps someday develop in them, but I don&#8217;t see them in my core.</p>

<p>While I do see the value in diversifying my language toolbox, I don&#8217;t see the
need to accessorize my toolbag. That&#8217;s read, Text Editor and IDE.
I&#8217;m a VIM guy. I like writing things in VIM, I&#8217;m writing this blog post in VIM,
and I&#8217;ve got the IDE features I want set up in VIM. Any features I&#8217;m missing I
can always add later. EMACS is cool, and some of my friends are EMACS people,
I&#8217;m not. It&#8217;s a similar situation with platforms. I&#8217;m not saying that I refuse
to learn Windows or work on a Windows platform, but I&#8217;m going to focus most of
my energy on linux and unix platforms.</p>

<h2>DevOps</h2>

<p>My half of my core are languages known as &#8220;system languages&#8221;.
Modern developers don&#8217;t get to sit in a box, build an application, and
rely on a sysadmin to deploy and scale it for them. We have the cloud now, which
means the applications we write can scale themselves and with a little help from
continuous integration, deploy themselves. The barriers of what languages are
used for what tasks are starting to melt. I&#8217;ve seen too many stacks falling over
or different parts of stacks falling over to not recognize the importance of
cloud applications.</p>

<p>There should be no buttons pushed by people, traffic logs or analytics analyzed
by hand, or code deployed manually. It isn&#8217;t practical nor efficient.
I&#8217;m bad at doing repetitive things, machines aren&#8217;t. Figuring out when an
application might get heavier traffic? That sounds like a lot of analysis of
several different angles. That sounds like a math problem.</p>

<p>All in all, I think I&#8217;ve got a solid core, but that&#8217;s for right now. I could
wake up tomorrow morning and realize <a href="/2013/11/09/machine-learning">I need to swap C++ with Python</a>.
I have little desire to be idealistic about my core. This early in the
game there is quite a heft of flexibility. Might as well use it.</p>
