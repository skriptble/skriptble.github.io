  <p>Sometimes getting out of town is the best thing to do. It adds perspective and
has a special way of reseting ones mind. There is a bonus in this trip as well,
I get to see a couple of developers I haven&#8217;t seen in a while.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Not too long ago I made the realization that New York City might not be a
good fit for me. There are plenty of great things going on here, a bunch of startups,
great employment opportunities, and I&#8217;ve made some awesome friends here. The
main problem is that it doesn&#8217;t fit well with my personality. I enjoy being
laid back and taking things as they come. I dislike hurrying up and waiting,
which is a near constant in this city. Perhaps I haven&#8217;t found the place in the
city with an attitude that&#8217;s more &#8220;move quickly&#8221; and less &#8220;rush, rush,
rush&#8221;<sup>1</sup>. As has been said many times to me, I can always come back.</p>

<p>The main problem is that I&#8217;m not inspired by this city, it was a safe move for
me. How can I expect myself to push boundaries in my career if I can&#8217;t push
boundaries concerning my choice of place to live. My goal is to move to the West Coast. If
that doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s off to somewhere new until I find a place that&#8217;s the
best fit possible. Not perfect, just the least sucky.</p>

<p>That is partly the reason for my trip out of town this weekend. I&#8217;m trying to
get out and explore the world. I think everyone should travel if they can,
especially if you have a career in web development where it&#8217;s  easier to find a
job that allows working remotely. Even if without a remote job, one with nice
vacation time works as well.</p>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<p>Exploring other cities outside one&#8217;s own also gives opportunities to
network. There&#8217;s no need to wait for a giant conference. Conference are great,
but sometimes a trip to see a couple of friends in the industry can be a less
costly and effective way to accomplish the same task. You can also spend a
little bit of time meeting some of their contacts
in a much less overwhelming environment. There are also times when just hanging out with a
couple of people is exactly what&#8217;s needed.</p>

<p>Exploring other cities has the nice side effect of seeing how other places are
similar and different from the one you inhabit. I traveled quite a bit as a
child, but I haven&#8217;t been anywhere outside of the United States (sans a
 couple trips to Canada). I plan on going to Europe, I would
like to experience what it&#8217;s like outside of the United States. That said, my
goals when traveling are different from the norm. If I&#8217;m getting out of town, I
want to relax and have a fun time exploring places. That should be read
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to book every second of every day doing something and I especially
don&#8217;t want to be near any tourist attractions&#8221;.</p>

<h2>Projects with Friends</h2>

<p>Distributed projects are the soul of the open source community. It wouldn&#8217;t work
if everyone had to be in a room or building together to build software. That
said, having a developer LAN party every once in a while isn&#8217;t a bad idea.
Instead of running around to tourist attractions I would rather find a chill
cafe and initiate a sprint. Especially since I&#8217;m going to Boston and I don&#8217;t eat
seafood. Having a relaxing weekend with a couple of friends that ends with
having a shiny new piece of code is always welcome.</p>

<p>Even with all the wonderful technology we have, like join.me, Google plus
hangouts, Skype, GitHub, and IRC, nothing beats some quality face to face pair
programming time. From what I&#8217;ve heard, there are people who believe pair
programming is a waste of time because it takes two developers. I&#8217;ve also heard
that code reviews are also a waste of resources. I can&#8217;t speak to code reviews
much, but I&#8217;ve had phenomenal pair programming experiences. I&#8217;ve been able
to solve major system bugs using it. I have faith the use of it prevents a
plethora of bugs as well.</p>

<p>Seriously though, is there really a need to have an excuse to visit your
friends and have fun doing what you love in a city that isn&#8217;t your own? I think
not.</p>

<p><small>1: Yes, those are two different things. Moving quickly involves having a
fast face but still taking the proper time to achieve a task. Rushing usually
comes with awful compromises and from my experience is caused by financial
strains.</small></p>
