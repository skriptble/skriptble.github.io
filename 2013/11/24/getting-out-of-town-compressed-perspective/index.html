  <p>Perspective is often offered in compressed doses. At times it takes a while to
uncompress the perspective that is acquired. Sometimes recursive uncompressing
is required. Less analogously, the lessons of life take some time to fully
realize.</p>

<h2>Complex Problems, Simple Solutions</h2>

<p>Getting out of town this weekend opened my eyes in more ways than I initially
thought it would. I didn&#8217;t actually do much coding, but I did realize that
complex problems often have a simple solution.
The problem is that the ways in which solutions are attempted fall short of the
problems they are meant to solve. One solution will solve multiple
problems, problems that only a few knew existed. Unfortunately monetary constrains
exist and we try to create a solution to a problem and hope
that these constraints give enough room to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they don&#8217;t. There is a misstep along the way that results in
something less than ideal. That becomes the ideal situation even
though it doesn&#8217;t quite solve the problem. We end up attempting to
solve the same problem is several different ways, instead of focusing on a
singular solution. Perhaps it&#8217;s the theorist I&#8217;ve become, or the developer I&#8217;ve
become, or a combination of both, but something tells me that if there are
multiple solutions to a problem, the problem either hasn&#8217;t been defined enough
or there are multiple problems being solved.</p>

<p>Case in point: programming languages. It seems there is a constant flow
of new languages being created, each trying to solve a minute problem area in
slightly different ways. From what I&#8217;ve witnessed this usually has something to
do with money. Newer languages that have become popular are abstractions on top
of already existing languages. Languages and utilities that exist to take one
language and shove it into another.</p>

<p>With more and more new things popping up, perhaps we as a community should take
a moment to figure out why it is that we feel the need to have multiples of
things. It&#8217;s likely the default answer is that there is no one-size-fits-all
solution to problems, which is correct. That doesn&#8217;t mean a problem should have
multiple solutions though. As I stated before, multiple solutions means
the problem hasn&#8217;t been defined well enough.</p>

<h2>Uncompressing Takes Time</h2>

<p>Uncompressing anything takes time. Sometimes a project springs up because
another project doesn&#8217;t provide the functionality required. Sometimes the
required functionality is never implemented in the original project,
which isn&#8217;t a problem because the two projects are solving two different issues.
If the first project resolves the issues the second project was created for,
the second project should merge into the first. This rarely happens.
Instead both projects start to fill out the other&#8217;s features, resulting
in two projects that do a similar set of core functionality in slightly
different ways.</p>

<p>This causes issues because redundancy in projects takes away from both. The projects
would be better serviced if they stuck to their respective areas or fused into a singular
project. This is rather idealistic though, there are several reasons why this
isn&#8217;t a practical approach, mainly it&#8217;s monetary.</p>

<p>Sometimes the problem stems from the time it takes to decompress the problem.
To extend on an what I wrote in a previous post, sometimes your gut has more
insight into the freshly uncompressed perspective that your conciousness is
taking a while to process. What matters is that when the processing is done,
that the appropriate actions are taken. When an idea is no longer valid we
shouldn&#8217;t keep it around for the sake of keeping it around. We should update and
adjust the things that are now rendered incorrect by the new information.</p>

<h2>Simply Uncompressed</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s still early, but I&#8217;ve definitely uncompressed the first round of
perspective I&#8217;ve gained from this weekend.
Part of it was in <a href="/2013/11/23/getting-out-of-town-perspective">yesterday&#8217;s post on perspective</a>,
but to extrapolate on the gut feeling a bit, sometimes we have to run with an
idea even when everyone else is against you. Especially when everyone else is
against you. Revisiting a problem either strengthens a solution or proves a
fault in it. Either way, the end result is a better solution.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with being wrong. In fact, being wrong is important. You
grow and become stronger, your ideals change, and you begin to evolve. It&#8217;s
important to remember that no singular idea is perfect. There are no
rights nor wrongs, only perspective views on problems and situations. We&#8217;ve all
had the slip up of talking in absolutes before. Few talk in firm absolutes,
there are usually some unspoken truths we place below the absolute. One of mine
is that absolutes I state usually are meant to not include the 95th percentile;
also known as the exceptions to the rule.</p>

<p>There is no correct way to build an application. There are no perfect
applications. There are applications that are wrong, but that&#8217;s simply an issue
of perspective. Correct implies a singular defined point at which everything
except this one method of doing a thing is incorrect. As with problems if there
were multiple corrects, it would be a sign the targeted thing isn&#8217;t defined well
enough. Unlike problems though, correctness is a scale, no single thing is ever
&#8216;correct&#8217;, there are only varying levels of correctness.</p>

<h2>Application to Web Development</h2>

<p>That was a heavy dose of theory. What does this newly uncompressed
perspective mean to me and web development in general? It reminds
me of something important. The systems that
we use are not perfect. They might actually be awful implementations of
solutions to problems, but they&#8217;re the best we&#8217;ve got right now. We should use
these systems, but not without a grain or two of salt<sup>1</sup>. We should
strive to take steps toward solving actual issues and not shoving solutions to
much greater problems onto a singular platform. The web is an amazing platform,
but it has quite a bit of expanding to do before it will actually be able to
tackle some of the problems we&#8217;re requesting of it.</p>

<p>Issues like accessibility, performance, and information structure are big
problems and we&#8217;ve created tools and methods to aid in adding these things to
the platform for newer things we build, but as it goes anything after writing
the first line of code is maintaining a legacy system<sup>2</sup>. If we can
craft tools that are geared toward handling as many legacy systems as possible
we&#8217;ll be better able to solve problems. For instance, instead of forcing
everyone to build accessibility into their site, create tools that converts
inaccessible sites into accessible ones. This doesn&#8217;t mean that the standard
shouldn&#8217;t be creating sites that are accessible, but we should be able to handle
the sites that aren&#8217;t and won&#8217;t be.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the web and technology as a whole has shown us that nothing is
impossible. Many things once believed to be unachievable are now achieved
with a few clicks. Some of the hardest problems we encounter are solvable.
Technology opens the doors to solving some of the hardest problems and tackling
the toughest issues. We just need to apply it with force.</p>
