  <p>Forward thinking is important. Lack of forward thinking can run a
project or a team into a dark place that&#8217;s not easy to get out of. As with
everything there is a flipside of that, which is the pitfall I usually find
myself in. That pitfall is thinking too far ahead.</p>

<h2>College Planning: A Small Tangent</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been the type of person that most would call an over achiever,
I plan things in advance as much as possible. When I was a college
freshman, I planned out all the classes I needed to take, during which semester,
for my all my undergrad years. It was great, when it came time to register
for classes I knew exactly what I needed to sign up for. That worked for a
semester. There was a big problem with this though: things change.</p>

<p>Over the course of that first year I changed my primary major twice and my
secondary major three times. Each time I changed a major, I would update the
list of classes I needed to take. Once I had settled on my majors and
planned out the remainder of college, I still changed courses every
semester. In addition, I felt like I was behind because I had lost a semester and
a half of course credits, so I shifted into overdrive and loaded on 18 credits a
semester. My strategic planning left me with a final semester of senior year
with no courses required, I could have graduated a semester early but who would
want to leave college early? I took some amazing courses and earned myself a 4.0
GPA for the semester.</p>

<p>Ultimately the intense planning worked out. I had a schedule that fit well every
semester and as I got tired of one way of taking classes I would shift. Having 8
hours of class on Tuesdays and Thursdays and free Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays got boring. The best schedule was definitely the 2 online classes and
class between 10am and 12:30pm everyday. My college experience was amazing, the
amount of planning was not.</p>

<h2>Planning Systems and Applications</h2>

<p>The point of that tangent is that while over planning landed me with nice class
schedules and an amazing college experience, I cold have achieved the
same goal by planning less rigorously. In fact, by my junior year I had stopped
planning out the next semester until it was time to register.</p>

<p>One of the hardest lessons for me to learn as a web developer has been to not
over plan. Recently I spent some time attempting to figure out how to make
application servers automatically scale up and down when traffic increased or
decreased. Copious research led me to believe this was something we would need
eventually. Further evaluation has shown that this might not actually be
necessary.</p>

<p>At the end of a few hours of researching I reminded myself that I was missing
the knowledge and getting too far ahead of myself. When I first started
developing I tried to learn a bunch of advanced things. I understand
these things now, but attempting to learn them right off the bat only led to
frustration. I didn&#8217;t posses the requisite knowledge to understand the
technology I was working with.</p>

<h2>Staying In The Moment</h2>

<p>Today, I had a meeting with some of my coworkers about how to architect some of
our applications going forward and I dawned on me that perhaps the autoscaling
features I was trying to focus on were not actually a space where we would ever
need to autoscale. Instead I realized I should be focusing on getting the most
out of every server we use. There are definitely different ideas of how to build
web applications and web sites, but the general way which I have been moving as
a developer is more code, more caching, and more optimization.</p>

<p>I embrace the school of thought in which problems are solved by solving the
problems that under lie them. Symptoms are often solved, when solving the actual
problem. From what I can gather, in the past we
had a certain number of tools that could only do a certain number of things. A
majority of us didn&#8217;t have the drive or knowledge to build a NoSQL database to
handle our data or add new layers of caching. Now we do. We can build
applications that fly, with strong data models that allow us to seamlessly
persist our data without the need to shred it into tables and rows. We can store
it in documents, graphs, and keys and values. There are new technologies
appearing all the time, we just need to embrace them.</p>

<p>That said, we shouldn&#8217;t make the mistakes I continue to make. Even though I&#8217;m
getting better, I still fall into the &#8220;well, after we&#8217;ve built everything
else and we need to scale this for the seven orders of magnitude increase in
traffic&#8230;.&#8221; trap. When I do, I remind myself to stay in the moment, to take one
step at a time. This works when you&#8217;re falling a bit behind too. Don&#8217;t think
&#8220;Well this is how we do this thing.&#8221;. Ask questions, and if you don&#8217;t know
<strong>why</strong> you&#8217;re doing something, figure it out before you do that thing again.</p>
