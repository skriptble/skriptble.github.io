  <p>Work today was interesting. I found myself face to face several times with
legacy systems that our team didn&#8217;t build, yet we needed to maintain them.
Yesterday there was a Drupal security update released for Drupal 6
and Drupal 7, adding to the required maintenance work.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Barnes and Noble is on a roll for the past few weeks, I have once again received
a 20% off coupon. I haven&#8217;t used it yet; I just got it this morning. I&#8217;ve seen a
book about software debt and I&#8217;ve contemplated buying it but I
wind up choosing something else. It has become apparent that living
in a bubble of new project work will only last so long. We are having some
problems maintaining our legacy systems, mostly bringing them from legacy status to
current status.</p>

<p>Unfortunately a badly built website is a badly built website. There isn&#8217;t a
magic wand to wave that makes them start working, but there is a chance to help
alleviate some of shortcomings. The shift to new infrastructure is opening the
doors to making these updates.</p>

<h2>Software Debt</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Debt isn&#8217;t always a bad thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s difficult to create software without
incurring debt. It might be possible is if the software
is small and maintenance tasks are handled quickly while updating the system
along the way.</p>

<p>There is a set of software that has found a way to shed a great amount of its
software debt over time. Modern browsers, except for Internet Explorer,
have started a race toward
keeping their software up to date. Chrome and Firefox are constantly releasing new
version of their software, and Chrome auto upgrades. This allows the
newest features to be adopted quickly which is important with the rate of
changing technology.</p>

<p>At the same time, possibly without any correlation, many frameworks have
begun to apply a standard release cycle. The features that are ready to go by
date X ship, the ones that aren&#8217;t ship with the next release. Instead of waiting
and baking in all the features before releasing the next version, they&#8217;re
rolling them out with whatever release they land near. Operating
systems like Ubuntu also follow this approach (and have for a while now).</p>

<h2>Updates, Updates, Updates!</h2>

<p>Managing software debt also requires a large number of updates to be sent out in
a steady stream. The newest
version of Wordpress (3.7) has automatic background updates built in and enabled
by default. Drupal checks for available updates, and updating involves a single
command or clicking through a few pages. The problem comes from updating custom code.
Even though these frameworks, plugins, and modules are all being constantly
updated, the custom code individual developers write is not. The only features
that are added are by the already bogged down developers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many years of thinking that if something isn&#8217;t broken it doesn&#8217;t
need to fixed has left a giant pile of awful bugs that need fixing and code that
needs transforming and refactoring. Maintenance work has opportunities
hidden inside that largely go unrecognized. Part of this infrastructure move at
work will hopefully come with some long over due maintenance work. There is part
of me that wonders what a couple weeks of my time dedicated to fixing and
updating individual pieces of websites and applications could do. I enjoy
working on new projects, but there is always a spotlight shining in my
face and high pressure.</p>

<p>Perhaps spending an hour or two a day focusing on updating legacy systems and
doing maintenance work on them would prove. Perhaps some of
the sites are a lost cause and a complete overhaul of their functionality would
be more useful. There is definitely a sense of pride and freedom being able to
create a new system instead of maintaining an older one. Perhaps new systems
need to be constructed to assist with maintenance? Or does that contradict the
point I&#8217;ve been trying to make?</p>

<h2>Something Needs To Change</h2>

<p>Whatever the solution, however a decision is made to fix the problem,
it&#8217;ll only work if steps are taken. The current way in which systems are created
and maintained is not working. Various people have said work takes up the time it
is alloted. Amazing system can be built in a
weekend that would otherwise taken months or years to build. The work of a week
under pressure can produce amazing products that months of planning would have
left broken on the floor, never advancing past the talking stage. Sprints are a
good way to accomplish this. This is one reason why I like the ideal of agile.
The use of MVPs and iterative development makes it much more manageable to
reach the end goal, but it feels like there is a part missing. The part that
says to stretch the limits with every sprint. Each one should be harder than the
last. It should require skills that are a little bit more out of the developer&#8217;s
comfort zones.</p>

<p>The world can be rid of legacy systems if more effort was placed on finding ways
to update and remove cruft. If more effort was placed into maintenance of old
systems, not in the traditional sense of fixing a singular issue, but in the new
sense of fixing the system up with every bug fixed. Take every chance to
refactor some code. Take the chances to rip out an old system and shift into
crunch drive and get it done. There is too much maintenance time wasted by not
thinking about the future. Sometimes its the clients who gage how much they want
to spend, but ultimately there are boundaries that developers can set. Sometimes
clients are penny wise and pound foolish<sup>1</sup>, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you have to be.
Take the extra hour to actually fix the problem instead of doing the most
minimal work possible. Keeping a system up to date benefits everyone involved,
and that extra hour will be a distant memory that will cause a smile when the
next time requires less work to fix the problem.</p>
