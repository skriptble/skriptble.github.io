  <p>Sometimes a little perspective is necessary. It can help you realize that
the place that is currently on the top 10 list of places you hate isn&#8217;t
actually that bad. There is always somewhere worse and somewhere better, someone who has it better
than you and someone who has it worse. There is no escaping it. That doesn&#8217;t
mean you can&#8217;t go searching for something better.</p>

<p>Close friends give great advice. The best ones are direct and tell you as it is,
no filtering. They have no desire to let you fall flat on your face, nor do they
want to not hurt your feelings, especially if what you&#8217;re doing is stupid. Those
are the kinds of friends I have.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re also supportive of the decisions you make, and they are there for you
even when you&#8217;re made an awful decision and are paying the price for it. They
give that perspective that you can&#8217;t see when you have blinders on.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve become intent on moving out of New York, without actually knowing if the
West Coast will actually be a place I want to move to. I haven&#8217;t visited, I
haven&#8217;t been that far west ever, and I&#8217;m taking a gut feeling approach to moving
out there. That said, it won&#8217;t be for another year or so until I move if I
ultimately decide to, which means I have time to visit. Being out of town this
weekend and visiting my friends reminded me that New York isn&#8217;t the devil city.
It has some nice qualities.</p>

<p>There are nice qualities about every city. As a young developer with no
restrictions on where I can live, it&#8217;s a little debilitating. I&#8217;m not forced to
live in a certain type of city or a certain area of the world. All I need is a
computer, some electricity, and a connection to the internet.</p>

<h2>Intuition</h2>

<p>Also known as &#8216;Going with your gut&#8217;, sometimes you know inexplicably why you
want to do something. From my experience it&#8217;s usually a collection of small
decisions and experiences over time that your subconscious throws together.
That&#8217;s why I know I&#8217;ll be happier on the West Coast. When I picked the college I
attended, I didn&#8217;t visit first, I just knew that it was a place where I wanted
to go. When I looked back a year and a half after being there, I realized there
were little interactions I had with the college I attended prior to attending.
In reality, visiting was a formality, it was the best choice for me because I decided to
make it the best choice.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the same thing with my core languages. I could have picked any 6 languages,
and they would have made a good core. The languages I picked weren&#8217;t haphazard,
they had a bunch of little decisions behind them. I&#8217;m finding as I begin to dive
into and talk about them that I know more about each language than I thought I
did.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the outcome of all of this?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trust your gut.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know yourself better than anyone else. You know what&#8217;s good for you. Don&#8217;t
make decisions purely based on what other people believe. When your gut is
telling you something isn&#8217;t right, don&#8217;t write it off immediately. As developers
ascend to experts many decisions become gut feelings. I&#8217;ve seen this occur in my
work a number of times. The decisions came as a result of many smaller decisions
I made along the way.</p>

<p>This weekend has only just begun, but I already know that it&#8217;s given me some
vital perspective that I was looking for.</p>
