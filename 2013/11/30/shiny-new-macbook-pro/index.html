  <p>My current MacBook Pro has been a warrior. It&#8217;s a 2010 model, with a core 2 duo
processor and 8GB of RAM. It has a SSD for the system drive (which uses the
optical drive space) and a 500GB 7200RPM drive where the regular system drive
goes. Sadly, it&#8217;s been through some rough times, include a 2 year period of just
not working. It&#8217;s started disconnecting the 500GB Media Drive, the trackpad
isn&#8217;t working as well, and Vagrant or any VM is nightmareisly slow. It&#8217;s time
for a shiny new MacBook Pro.</p>

<h2>Weight Matters</h2>

<p>While my trusty 13&#8221; MacBook Pro is on it&#8217;s last legs, my 15&#8221; non-retina MacBook
Pro is still going strong. Problem is the thing is heavy and cluttered with a
mess of stuff. It&#8217;s running a bit light on RAM, has a spinning disk, and the
display isn&#8217;t retina. That weight thing is the killer though. I live in New York
City, so I spend most of my time getting around via walking or taking a subway.
Having an extra couple pounds on my back is not the ideal situation.</p>

<p>Plus, separation of concerns: I use the 15&#8221; MacBook Pro for photography and
video editing. I use my current 13&#8221; MacBook Pro for web development. While
possible, I would rather not overload a computer with too many things<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about getting a new computer for a while, so it isn&#8217;t as if I
just decided spontaneously to buy one. Just like the core languages I choose to
learn, this decision came from many months of planning and realizing that my
computer wasn&#8217;t going to last forever.</p>

<h2>Forward Thinking</h2>

<p>Another reason I choose to buy new instead of fix up the old and dual purpose is
that starting new allows me to plan out how I&#8217;m going to set up my computer.
While this is another circumstance where maintenance could be better than
starting new, it isn&#8217;t so easy. I haven&#8217;t used my photog and video MacBook Pro
for web development in a few years. The software is old, the development systems
I used are completely different now, and there are several programs on the
machine that take up space and bog down the system<sup>2</sup>. Overall buying
new allows me to get the specs I need, without the bulk I don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>During the Full Stack Engineering Meetup I went to a few days ago, one of the
presenters said that you should use tools that do most of what you want and no
more. Meaning that you shouldn&#8217;t use something that does way more than you need
because it goes to waste.</p>

<p>When I purchased my photog and video MacBook Pro, I was thinking about video
editing. I have a graphics card that eats of the battery, not a ton of RAM, a
large amount of storage space, and a powerful CPU. I was also thinking I would
be close to a power source, mainly because video editing eats up the battery.
This is major overkill for a web development computer. I work in the terminal,
so a graphics card isn&#8217;t on the top of my mind. I need RAM for the virtual
machines and databases I run. I don&#8217;t need much storage space, most of my files
measure in the kilobytes or megabytes, not gigabytes like video files. While I
am getting into concurrent programming, I need more CPUs not more powerful ones.
Finally, I live in New York City and cafes like not having power
available<sup>3</sup>. If I don&#8217;t want to be tied to my apartment or office, I
need a long lasting battery life. I can get a couple hours out of my WebDev
MacBook Pro right now but that doesn&#8217;t give much time to work on projects.
Especially on a weekend day.</p>

<h2>What Shiny I Got</h2>

<p>So I got the shiny MacBook Pro with retina display. I originally wanted one with
256GB of solid state storage, but they only had the configuration I wanted with
512GB of solid state storage. I could have ordered it and had it shipped, but
that&#8217;s another two or more weeks. Trying to figure out where I&#8217;ll be to receive
the machine and having to deal with a rapidly dying WebDev MacBook Pro (the
Media Drive just disconnected again so it only allows reads not writes) I just
can&#8217;t afford to deal with the frustration.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I&#8217;m very happy that I was able to get everything in order
to purchase a new computer so quickly. With my tight timeline for goals, I can&#8217;t
afford to lose weeks of time getting back on my feet from a computer failure.
Not losing progress is well worth the extra $200.</p>

<p><small>1: Even though I&#8217;ve already done this ten times over with my MacPro. Yes.
I know. I&#8217;m a ridiculous geek who gives all my money away to Apple.</small></p>

<p><small>2: I&#8217;m looking at you Adobe.</small></p>

<p><small>3: It makes sense. I wouldn&#8217;t want a bunch of people hanging out in my
coffee shop all day if they aren&#8217;t buying stuff. It also runs up power
bills.</small></p>
