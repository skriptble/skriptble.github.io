  <p>I struck lucky this week and received another 20% off coupon from Barnes and
Noble. I am at the point where focusing on my core is important, so I&#8217;m trying
to buy books that help me focus on that core. There is a Go book I&#8217;ve been
eyeing for a while, but I&#8217;m determined to learn Go and most of Erlang using the
resources of the web, not books. Multiple avenues of learning is going to be
very important on this journey. That left me with a problem: Should I pass up a
chance to save 30% on a book?</p>

<h2>Skill Level: Ninja</h2>

<p>Of course I didn&#8217;t pass up saving 30% off a book. I have a habit of identifying
books and thinking about them overtime. Now that I get newsletters from multiple
publishers, I have some idea of the books I want before I get to the store. This
week&#8217;s choice was a Javascript book co-authored by the creator of jQuery,
<a href="http://www.manning.com/resig/">Secrets of the Javascript Ninja</a>. Javascript is
one of the languages in my core, so I&#8217;m not deviating or cheating <a href="/2013/11/09/machine-learning">like I did
last week</a>.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I did pick up a couple of books on regular expressions. After some
evaluation I decided that it made more sense for me to sharpen up my Javascript.
As a bonus the book I bought has a chapter dedicated to regular expressions. I
see regular expressions as one of those auxiliary technologies I need to learn.
Knowing six programming languages isn&#8217;t much use without the addition of other
technologies.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to have this book though. While web applications powered entirely by
the server are cool and all, having some sharp Javascript skills definitely
makes a difference. As with most things, it&#8217;s not one or the other. Building
great web applications requires both server-side and client-side code.
Understanding the lower level languages is also important. Dart 1.0 was released
a couple of days ago and I read up on some of the chatter about it&#8217;s release. I
tried it out about a year ago, but I didn&#8217;t end up getting involved in it. I
wasn&#8217;t interested in front end development at the time.</p>

<p>Overtime Dart might gain more traction over Javascript, but I still see value in
learning vanilla Javascript. There&#8217;s also a chance it will help me learn Dart
as well. I stuck with PHP instead of switching to python, ruby, C#, or Java.
I&#8217;ve invested quite a bit of time in learning Javascript already as well. If
you&#8217;re just starting out, perhaps it wouldn&#8217;t be a bad idea to go grab the Dart
download and try out the tutorial. Especially if you want to get to building
things right away.</p>
