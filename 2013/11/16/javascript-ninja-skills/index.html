  <p>I struck lucky this week and received another 20% off coupon from Barnes and
Noble. I am at the point where focusing on my core is important, so I&#8217;m buying
books that help me focus. There is a Go book I&#8217;ve been
eyeing for a while, but I&#8217;m determined to learn Go and most of Erlang using the
resources of the web, not books. Multiple avenues of learning is going to be
on this journey. That left me with a problem: Should I pass up a
chance to save 30% on a book?</p>

<h2>Skill Level: Ninja</h2>

<p>Of course I didn&#8217;t pass up saving 30%. I have a habit of identifying
books and thinking about them ahead of time. Now that I get newsletters from multiple
publishers, I have an idea of the books I want before I get to the store. This
week&#8217;s choice was a Javascript book co-authored by the creator of jQuery,
<a href="http://www.manning.com/resig/">Secrets of the Javascript Ninja</a>. Javascript is
one of the languages in my core, so I&#8217;m not deviating or cheating <a href="/2013/11/09/machine-learning">like I did
last week</a>.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I did pick up a couple of books on regular expressions. After some
evaluation I decided that it made more sense for me to sharpen my Javascript
skills.
As a bonus the book I bought has a chapter dedicated to regular expressions. I
see regular expressions as one of those auxiliary technologies I need to learn.
Knowing six programming languages isn&#8217;t much use without the addition of other
technologies.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to have this book though. While web applications powered entirely by
the server are cool, having sharp Javascript skills definitely
makes a difference. As with most things, it&#8217;s not one or the other. Building
great web applications requires both server-side and client-side code.
Understanding the lower level languages is important, too. Dart 1.0 was released
a couple of days ago and I read up on some of the chatter about it&#8217;s release. I
tried it out about a year ago, but I didn&#8217;t end up getting involved in it. I
wasn&#8217;t interested in front end development at the time.</p>

<p>Over time Dart might gain more traction over Javascript, but I still see value in
learning vanilla Javascript. I&#8217;ve invested quite a bit of time in learning Javascript already.
There&#8217;s also a chance it will help me learn Dart as well. Starting now it might make more sense
to learn Dart, especially if you want to get to building things right away. From
what I can tell, it&#8217;s there to make it easier to build web applications and it
outperforms Javascript.</p>

<h2>Coffeescript</h2>

<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of technologies that compile to Javascript, it makes
sense to talk about Coffeescript. This language makes sense, because it adds a
bunch of syntactic sugar to Javascript and helps make up for the places where
Javascript comes up short. My core in learning the core isn&#8217;t to take the easy
way and avoid the tough problems. Many say that Javascript is just a badly
designed language, similar things are said about PHP. Everything begins the look
like a bad design when we discover new designs in the world, unfortunately it
isn&#8217;t as easy to simply adapt newer designs to older systems. Something I&#8217;ve
learned is that every system is a legacy system. After that first line of code
is written, everything going forward is a maintenance task.<sup>1</sup> This
means we can&#8217;t simply replace the badly designed thing with a better designed
one. We should instead focus on improving the thing itself.</p>

<p>Coffeescript allows from Javascript to be written inside of it, and for the
short term it doesn&#8217;t solve many problems. Similar to Dart, starting a brand new
project with Coffeescript makes sense. Using Dart or Coffeescript also makes
sense if a project is being rewritten from the ground up. That isn&#8217;t every
project though. Just like C-extensions are written for PHP, sometimes the higher
level language can&#8217;t accomplish the task at hand, and that doesn&#8217;t always
pertain to performance, although sometimes it does.</p>

<h2>jQuery</h2>

<p>Another area that I am puzzled by at times is the use of jQuery. The web
development community has a nasty case of framework-itis and library-itis.
Everytime we wish to accomplish a task we throw in a new library or adapt a new
framework. This creates lock in and sometimes kills performance. Libraries and
frameworks have their place, but as happens with many tools (divitis anyone?)
sometimes we over use the tool.</p>

<p>I want to explore the options of using vanilla Javascript to handle some tasks.
It feels more targeted, and once again I find my Javascript skills lacking
because I&#8217;ve been leaning on jQuery as a crutch. Understanding the underlying
technology of a frame, library, or tool is more important than knowing how to
use it. Uninformed developers may use a library like jQuery even though a native
Javascript function will perform better and require less documentation.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to be diving into Javascript at a deeper level. The skills I will
gain from this will help me in other areas of my core. Between this book and
<a href="http://www.manning.com/mikowski/">Single Page Web Applications</a>, I think I&#8217;ll
be able to build some powerful front end applications.</p>

out, it&#8217;s a great book!</p>
