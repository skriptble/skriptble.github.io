  <p>I used to hate reading books when I was younger. I&#8217;ve always been a slow reader,
and I was much more interested in writing and creating something than reading
what others had created. As I&#8217;ve grown up I&#8217;ve spent more time reading, but it&#8217;s
been pretty painful because of the slow reader problem. While doing laundry
today I realized something: environments matter.</p>

<h2>Concentration</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s the reason why I usually have trouble reading. Either there are too many
distractions from the outside world or my mind won&#8217;t calm down enough for me to
focus on the topic at hand. Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t even stop be from reading
either. So I&#8217;ll read a few pages before I notice that I haven&#8217;t been processing
what I&#8217;ve been reading and I&#8217;m actually just thinking about something completely
different. Then I go back and reread what I just read. Frustration ensues.</p>

<p>While I was doing laundry this evening I decided to try and finish reading a
book I&#8217;ve been working on for a couple weeks now. I&#8217;ve been taunted by the icon
on the back that indicates it&#8217;s a 5 hour read. In about one and a half hours I
managed to get to almost the end of the book, which amazed me. I felt myself
enter a zone where I was in text.</p>

<p>I used to be able to do this when I had my awful hour and a half long commute to
work. I would starting reading a book on the A train, and the time flew by as I
became engrossed in the text. This commute was actually helpful, I managed to
get through a large number of books over the course of a couple months because I
had 3 hours a day to focus on reading. I don&#8217;t get the same results with my now
10 minute commute.</p>

<p>When the internet is in front of you, it&#8217;s hard to step away for 3 hours to
focus on reading. There is a constant buzz in your pocket from email, friends
wanting to hang out, and a newsfeed that needs tending too. I managed to let all
that go while I chewed through this book.</p>

<h2>A Greater Analogy</h2>

<p>One of my coworkers is awesome at coming up with analogies. I fancy myself a
pretty good analogy creator, but he&#8217;s definitely more of a pro. It&#8217;s probably
from years of making them up. Being able to really get into reading tonight</p>
