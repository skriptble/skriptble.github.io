  <p>When I was younger, I hated reading books. I&#8217;ve always been a slow reader,
and I was much more interested in creating something than reading
what others had created. As I&#8217;ve grown up I&#8217;ve spent more time reading, but it&#8217;s
been pretty painful because of the slow reader problem. While doing laundry
today I realized something: environments matter.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2>Concentration</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s the reason why I usually have trouble reading. Either there are too many
distractions from the outside world or my mind won&#8217;t calm down enough for me to
focus on the topic at hand. It doesn&#8217;t even stop me from reading
either. I&#8217;ll read a few pages before I notice that I haven&#8217;t been processing
what I&#8217;ve been reading and I&#8217;m just thinking about something completely
different. Then I go back and reread what I just read. Frustration ensues.</p>

<p>While I was doing laundry this evening I decided to try and finish reading a
book I&#8217;ve been working on for a couple weeks now. I&#8217;ve been taunted by the icon
on the back that indicates it&#8217;s a 5 hour read. In about one and a half hours I
managed to get to almost the end of the book, which amazed me. I felt myself
enter a zone where all that mattered were the words on the page.</p>

<p>I used to be able to do this when I had my hour and a half long commute to
work. I would starting reading a book on the A train, and the time flew by as I
became engrossed in the text. This commute was actually helpful, I managed to
get through a large number of books over the course of a couple months because I
had 3 hours a day to focus on reading. I don&#8217;t get the same results with my now
10 minute commute<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>When the internet is in front of you, it&#8217;s hard to step away for 3 hours to
focus on reading. There is a constant buzz in your pocket from email, friends
wanting to hang out, and a newsfeed that needs tending too. I managed to let all
that go while I chewed through this book.</p>

<h2>A Greater Analogy</h2>

<p>One of my coworkers is awesome at coming up with analogies. I fancy myself a
pretty good analogy creator, but he&#8217;s definitely a professional. It&#8217;s probably
from years of making them up. Being able to get into reading tonight made
me wonder what else would be aided if I simply found a better environment to
work in. I&#8217;ve found myself in the zone several times over the past few days,
mostly because I&#8217;m working on something exciting a new. I always get really
passionate about projects like these but I always have trouble keeping steam.
Mostly that happens because I run into too many problems or another task comes
up that requires more attention.</p>

<p>I need to accept that I work best when I can focus on something and
there is some immediacy to it. I power read a book last week, about 200 pages
and I got through it, while doing almost all the examples in a couple of days. I
usually can&#8217;t accomplish that, but I somehow made it happen. We have a &#8220;get this
done now&#8221; deadline for the project I&#8217;m working on. The problem is, with many
&#8220;get this done now&#8221; projects is that there is a new &#8220;get this done now&#8221; project
that comes up about 30 seconds after I get into the groove of the first one.
Remembering back to the knowledge I&#8217;ve gained from books<sup>2</sup> I realized
that to get a large project done I need to pick a number of things to accomplish
on it per day and ensure I get those done. While doing that at work has proven
difficult, this blog is byproduct that shows I can do that.</p>

<p>Ultimately I think that being able to work in a number of environments is
important. Being able to adapt to a multitude of them is required for a
developer, and being comfortable using many tools is as well. Environments
matter though, and finding one that encourages efficient usage of time is worth
it. That&#8217;s one of the reasons why I work and do nearly every task at
work in VIM. Using an environment that I&#8217;m efficient in makes tasks that I&#8217;m not
so efficient at get done more quickly. When developing, the small things can
really start to add up. Knowing the key strokes, being able to move around the
files quickly, understanding which commands do what, these are all important
things about being able to use an editor. When I log into a new server and I
need to edit a file and I get dropped into nano or emacs I automatically spend
twice the amount of time I would have in VIM trying to figure out how the heck
to get exit it, only to have to redo the task in VIM because I didn&#8217;t accomplish
it in Nano or emacs. I&#8217;ve gotten much better and can even edit things in nano now but
it is still foreign (I enjoy having modes).</p>

<p><small>1: I&#8217;m not complaining about this. Having a 10 minute commute gives me 2
and a half ours of my life back everyday. I dislike spending 3 hours a day
underground with no cell signal.</small>
<small>2: This one comes from <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/kcdc/the-developer-s-code">The Developers
Code</a>, another book I
recommend.</p>
