  <p>Today makes a second day in a row that I will be attending a Meetup. Tonight&#8217;s
topic is Analytics and Content Management  with MongoDB. I&#8217;ve begun to use
MongoDB in more of my work, but I feel like some of the use cases for it are
still out of my reach. I&#8217;m hoping the Meetup tonight goes as well as last
night&#8217;s did.</p>

<h2>Expectations</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m not exactly sure what I&#8217;m expecting to gain from the Meetup tonight, but I
think that&#8217;s one of the best ways to walk into Meetups. Open minds are important
when entering a learning environment. It&#8217;s easier to absorb knowledge
this way instead of waiting for the particular knowledge desired to come up. I also hope
this adds a touch of inspiration to get me remotivated to work on the
reservation project. I read an article today about PHP developers who live in the
gap between the novices and the professionals. This article definitely applies
to more than just PHP developers though. Being a professional involves expanding
skills which can only be achieved by doing things. Learn frameworks, databases, write
programs, and rewrite them in other frameworks and databases. That&#8217;s the plan I
have for the reservation system and whatever other mini projects I come up with
along the way, with an added layer of translating them into
other languages as well. Tonight&#8217;s Meetup will hopefully provide the insight
into MongoDB that I need.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t have any expectations walking into the Meetup. That said, if
I had that expectations they would have been met. I walked away with some new
knowledge in my arsenal and a reminder that big problems take more than an out
of the box solution.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve evolved as a developer in a time when there is a massive pushback from the
&#8216;Not Invented Here&#8217; syndrome. Every turn taken is into another area of &#8216;Someone
else has already done it, so you don&#8217;t need to&#8217; suggestions. I&#8217;ve heard it for
just about everything I want to do and for a while I&#8217;ve had this nagging feeling
that something isn&#8217;t fitting quite right. The problem is that we have gone from
one end of the spectrum to the complete opposite end. There is now
pressure to not write your own thing and use whatever tools are already available
to do what you need done. Drupal&#8217;s version of this is the contrib module space.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that there hasn&#8217;t been enough focus placed on when to
occupy which side of that line. After many months of hearing the same thing I
decided to push back and what I&#8217;ve found is a wonderful open landscape to build
some truly amazing things in. The problem with using everyone else&#8217;s stuff is
twofold. First, developers don&#8217;t generally build solutions that fit the specific
problem at hand. Secondly, if everyone is using everyone else&#8217;s code, then who&#8217;s
actually writing new code or breaking barriers?</p>

<p>This ultimately led me down a road of believing that solutions came out of a box
and attempting to build a custom solutions wasn&#8217;t a
good thing. All the components I needed to do whatever I was looking to do were
built into the system I was using. I&#8217;ve since realized this is false, and most
systems require customization.</p>

<p>Back to discussion of the Meetup, the first thing that really grabbed my
attention was the way in which the presenter (a developer at Appboy) described
the analytics that they gather. I already knew how the model worked for
preaggregated data, but when he was talking something just opened up in my mind
and I suddenly understood MapReduce<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the Appboy presentation and into the Aviary talk, I
realized two important things: Generating things like UI is an awesome
idea, and scale requires complex systems. The complex system part
baffled me for a little. I found myself asking questions of why the system they
built felt and looked so complex. Then I realized that all that complexity was a
formation of several simplicities that came together to form a rather simple
system. The complexity only existed when viewed as a whole.</p>

<p>Back to that first point for a moment. I discovered the concept of code
generation a while ago, granted I didn&#8217;t understand it at the time. Part of
Aviary&#8217;s platform includes a system which has an application with a generated UI
and a simple but effective permission system. It reminded me of one of the systems we
have at work, except that system is more complex, from the editing
interface to the permission system to retrieving data from it. The system
being described tonight wasn&#8217;t that. It wasn&#8217;t complex complex, it was simple
complex. That alone helps drive me to push the cruft out of the way so we can
focus on the larger tasks, like taking the complex complex systems and creating
simple complex systems from them.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m glad that I made the decision to attend another Meetup this week. I&#8217;ve
found the right niche of developers to motivate me to achieve larger goals than
I could have before. These past two nights have reminded me that while there are
many awesome things in the world, there are many more awesome things to be
created. Those awesome things need builders, and I am ready to be a builder of
that awesomeness.</p>
