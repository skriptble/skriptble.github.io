  <p>Another day another Meetup. While I was fully expecting this Meetup to be like
the rest, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and information of this one.
The quality of the informative post-Meetup drinks session was also surprising.
Even though it was tough getting to the Meetup, I find myself happy that I
decided to take the trip.</p>

<h2>The Meetup</h2>

<p>I have given Apple credit for Apple maps before, but one of the largest blunders
I&#8217;ve seen is the Meetup app combined with Apple maps. Unfortunately, Apple maps
doesn&#8217;t know how to parse out the helpful information (like which streets a
building is in between) from the actual address, leading to absolutely bizarre
addresses. The flavor today was pointing toward midtown instead of Tribecca.
Oops. This unfortunate snafu resulted in my being half an hour late to the
meetup. I missed part of the first presentation, however, the Meetup was still
well worth it.</p>

<p>The topics discussed weren&#8217;t the normal type of information that I usually hear
at Meetups. I knew almost instantly that this Meetup was different. From what I
understand the concept of a Full Stack Engineer is new, but I think it&#8217;s the
description that I&#8217;ve been looking for to explain my need to work on multiple
layers of the stack.</p>

<p>Some of the interesting tibits of information I came away with were staggered
deployments, reducing the size of the technology stack being used, and nifty
tools like DTrace. While the technologies discussed are fascinating, I found the
post Meetup drink sessions equally engaging. Some of the people I met are
definitely the types of people that I&#8217;ve been looking for.</p>

<p>The most prominent revelation I had it something that has been bothering me for
many months now. I remember about 6 months ago I was feeling down on Drupal due
to my coworkers requests that I didn&#8217;t know how to solve. Eventually I dove into
development more and discovered how to fulfill these request and was once again
excited about using Drupal, but there was that part of me that was constantly
fighting against it. Part of me that realized there are some large flaws in
Drupal that aren&#8217;t being properly solved.</p>

<h2>The Evolution</h2>

<p>For a while I&#8217;ve been thinking about how amazing Drupal 8 will be and how it
will solve some large problems. Thanks to someone I met at this meetup, my
suspicions of how much Drupal 8 fixes have been reaffirmed. I knew there would
still be problems with Drupal, I knew there would be things that didn&#8217;t function
as well, and I knew our team would still need custom processes. What I didn&#8217;t
realize was the core thing that makes Drupal so awesome also makes Drupal not
the technology that I see myself  using as much in the future.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, Drupal is awesome. It&#8217;s a powerful system that can handle
almost any task that&#8217;s thrown at it, but it has many shortcomings. As we build
more complex projects at work, these shortcomings are becoming apparent. It is
becoming difficult to continue to use systems like Drupal (or any of the
traditional content management systems) when what we&#8217;re building is a hybrid web
app website.</p>

<p>Drupal is geared toward a certain demographic of web developers and designers.
The same goes for other tools like Wordpress and any tool. The problem I
continually encounter is that Drupal doesn&#8217;t feel like quite the right fit for
the production projects I&#8217;ve been building. Drupal functions very well for the
prototypes we build, but complex systems feel overly complex at many levels, and
some of reasons why I felt the need to continue using Drupal stem from
inadequacies in my own understanding of engineering.</p>

<h2>Following In Footsteps: A pre-evolution tale</h2>

<p>I never intended on becoming an engineer. Both of my parents went to college and
studied computer science. My dad got a masters in it. Growing up it was a
constant at family gatherings, especially as I got closer to college, that
someone would ask what I was going to go to college for. It was always be
followed with an immediate &#8220;Computer Science like your dad?&#8221;, to which I would
respond with various answers depending on the year, but the most resounding
answer was &#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to be an author. I&#8217;m going to school for writing&#8221;. I
did not want to follow in my dad&#8217;s footsteps, I was a creative and my dad always
told me to take advantage of that<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t escape it though. I remember being a young preteen and getting book
son how to build a blog. I still have my first programming book, and even though
it&#8217;s very much beat up, I still cherish it. QBasic was the first programming
language I learned and stopping myself from that point was moot, I was hooked.
It wasn&#8217;t until college that I actually understand how to solve problems with
programming. I took 2 courses in high school, one on C and the other a
continuation of the first in C++.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll write more about how I wound up as a software engineer at another point,
but what I&#8217;ve come to realize is that resist as I might, I was heading toward
being a Full Stack Engineer. I tried to focus on just the programming language
layer, and not the database. Then I had to start learning how databases worked,
which lead to optimizing my code, which lead to caching, which lead to custom
server implementations, which lead to learning Linux, which lead to bare metal.
It wasn&#8217;t as synchronous as that, but that&#8217;s essentially how it happened.</p>

<p>I picked up a book on <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920017776.do">Making Embedded
Systems</a> a few weeks ago, and
I realized that I had done the exact opposite of what I said: I had followed in
my dad&#8217;s footsteps. Today I realized that while I am doing the same types of
things as my dad, I haven&#8217;t violated that creative determination I made. During
the post Meetup drink session, I found myself with a group of guys talking
heavily about theory, mostly mathematical and database theory, but theory
nonetheless. I&#8217;ve had a constant problem finding a place where I felt I
belonged. During the conversation, the ease which people switched between theory
and concrete topics resonated with the way in which my mind functions. I
realized that while engineering is usually seen as extremely technical it is
also extremely creative.</p>

<p>At the end of the day I think I&#8217;ve found something important on multiple
levels. While it was only one person who I talked in depth with Drupal about,
his words were the encouragement I needed to realize that my thoughts and
concerns were valid. That my uneasiness with using Drupal for so much wasn&#8217;t
just me and that it actually validated. I, like many Drupalist, put Drupal and
companies like Acquia on a pedestal. I try hard not to idealize things. I use
Ubuntu, but it isn&#8217;t the best Linux out there, and MongoDB is the best database,
PHP isn&#8217;t the best language, and Macs are not the best development environment.
For some reason, I felt for a long time that Drupal was the best web platform.
It isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a decent web platform, but my desire to be a Full Stack Engineer
appears to directly conflict with the community push for how to use Drupal. I
find PaaS an interesting concept, but I am beginning to realize that I will most
likely only go as high as IaaS and might use PaaS for some things, but
ultimately my desire to understand and tinker won&#8217;t work with PaaS unless I&#8217;m
running the PaaS.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this Meetup opened my eyes to realizing that there isn&#8217;t something
wrong with how I feel. I&#8217;m not doing anything wrong and simply wishing to
have a deeper understanding doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m doing things wrong. I am a builder.
A creative engineer. I am a creative builder.</p>
