  <p>I love the development environment I use. When I talk to people about it,
several don&#8217;t understand the choices I made in the tools I&#8217;ve selected. The one
tool that really baffles some is my use of VIM over an IDE. I&#8217;ve tried IDE&#8217;s
before. I&#8217;ve used Eclipse, Aptana, Sublime, TextWrangler, none of them feel like
a right fit. That&#8217;s just the first tool, from my editor to my shell, I like to
ride a bit outside the norm.</p>

<h2>It starts with your workflow</h2>

<p>The reasons I use my unique set of tools stems from the way I develop
applications. At work, I build my applications on a development server or a
VirtualBox style set up. Personal work I usually do somewhere between VirtualBox
and locally installed applications.</p>

<h3>VIM</h3>

<p>The most important tool in a developer&#8217;s toolbox is a text editor. It&#8217;s hard to
write code if you don&#8217;t have a thing to write code in. For this task I picked
VIM. I could have easily wound up with emacs, but through some series of events
I fell into VIM. So why not use an IDE? Something full featured with nice things
like syntax highlighting and autocomplete? Well, I do actually. My VIM
environment is configured with a bunch of plugins that give me the features I
want without the ones I don&#8217;t. The main feature I dislike about IDE&#8217;s is FTP. I
hate FTPing files around. Vagrant can help mitigate this problem, and it works
great when you&#8217;re working alone. When you&#8217;re on a team, though, having to do a
git commit and push or FTP the files and run an update script is time consuming.
Sometimes you want to copy and paste the link in your browser to a coworker and
ask them to take a look.</p>

<p>That said, I&#8217;m sure some of the newer IDEs have solutions to these problems.
That&#8217;s great an awesome, and maybe I&#8217;ll give them a try sometime. For now, VIM
is my editor of choice. It has the nice bonus of being able to edit almost any
text file I come across too. Score!</p>

<h3>ZSH</h3>

<p>The second most important tool to me is the shell. Since I work on servers with
no GUI, most of my day is spent in the shell, either inside of VIM or running
various command . A shell that gives me the ability to work efficiently pays
dividends. I found ZSH a number of months ago and I haven&#8217;t looked back. I&#8217;m
still discovering new features of ZSH, some of which are present in BASH, and
some that are just simpler to implement in ZSH. Since I use VIM, I&#8217;ve decided to
switch the default emacs bindings to VIM bindings, which will hopefully increase
my productivity in the end.</p>
