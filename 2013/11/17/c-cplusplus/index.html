  <p>I am on a roll with discounts lately. It almost feels like I picked the perfect
time to choose the core languages I want to learn. Or there are always deals and
now I&#8217;m just utilizing them. Or it&#8217;s the holiday season so everything is on
sale. It doesn&#8217;t really matter the reason, I got a hefty 40% discount on 2 books
I just bought.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2>C++ Primer</h2>

<p>Not to be confused with C++ Primer Plus. From my research this is one of the
best books to learn C++. The only downside is it&#8217;s a heavyweight, coming in at
just under 1,000 pages. As much as I love printed books, there was no way I was
going to carry that thing anywhere, it would double the load I already carry
with me. I&#8217;m realizing that theory and non-coding books are great for
print, but trying to type the code in from a printed book while trying to keep
it open and not make a mistake is a bit too much to tackle. My terminal is
configured so it&#8217;s in drop down from the top visor mode. It&#8217;s also partially
transparent, which means I can read text through it.</p>

<p>This didn&#8217;t matter much before, because the only way I could read an iBook was
on my iPad or iPhone. Reading the PDF versions was annoying because it doesn&#8217;t
sync the pages across my devices.<sup>1</sup> With the release of iBooks on OS
X that problem is now solved. In my <a href="/2013/11/15/puppet-automate-all-the-things">quest to learn Puppet</a>, I am taking full
advantage of this. I&#8217;m making speedy progress through the book, and part of that
I can attribute to being able to look at a single screen to do the examples and
read the text. I am excited to read this book, and learn a lower level language.
Perhaps along the way I can learn to write a PHP extension or two.</p>

<h2>C Primer Plus</h2>

<p>Unlike C++ Primer Plus, this book has great reviews, and while I&#8217;m not a
complete new comer to C I think I need to start in the beginner realm. I took
a chance and pre-ordered the new edition which is set to be released in early
December. While this book also comes in at over 1,000 pages I&#8217;m ready to get
an in depth look at one of core languages of computing today. As I traverse to
deeper levels of programming and application development, my lack of
understanding in areas such as memory management or input output operations is
holding me back.</p>

<p>Since part of my core are two functional languages I believe knowing this base
language will help me understand more why I would choose one of those languages
over C. Currently I have a number of other resources that tell me I should learn
Go and Erlang for various reasons, but Google and Stackoverflow won&#8217;t be able to
tell me which projects I should use a functional language over an object
oriented or procedural language on.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found it difficult to use online resources to learn both (C and C++) of these
languages. Most online resources are dated or don&#8217;t give me the theory I need to
understand why I&#8217;m writing this code. If I don&#8217;t understand something, I won&#8217;t
be able to use it later on. It won&#8217;t stick well and I&#8217;ll wind up doing it
the wrong or a much more inefficient way.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m excited to have added these two books to my collection.
I&#8217;ve been eyeing them for a while, and once again discounts have given me the
perfect opportunity to buy them at a steal.</p>

<p><small>1: Yes I do realize how much of a &#8216;First World Problem&#8217; this is. <em>My
eBooks don&#8217;t sync their pages from my iPhone and iPad to the PDF&#8217;s on my
computer.</em> In reality, I&#8217;m not even sure if the syncing works between OSX
iBooks and iOS iBooks.</p>
