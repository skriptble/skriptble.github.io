  <p>Initial perfection isn&#8217;t possible. The launch day is not the day an application
or website will be perfected. This is why building minimum viable products
and take smaller steps makes sense. Shipping is the most important thing,
because the best product in the world won&#8217;t matter if it never sees the light of
day.</p>

  <p>&#8220;The first step is the hardest&#8221;
  <small>An old and tired clich√©</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is wrong. While the first step is hard, it is certainly not that hardest
and sometimes, it isn&#8217;t even hard.
The first step is usually pretty easy, especially when starting a web application. Make a
git repository, write an opening line of code, and make the initial commit. Code
is cheap, especially compared to other disciplines like architecture or
manufacturing. Those disciplines have physical things that are created. An
issue with a building after it&#8217;s begun construction or product after some have
been manufactured can become costly quickly. A bug in code doesn&#8217;t necessarily have the same ascent.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s import to get that thing being built into the hands of the users as soon as
possible. Being first to market is important. The iPhone was the
first phone of its type, and while the market is now filled with similar
products, Apple had an advantage from getting there first. Same goes for
applications.</p>

<p>Shipping first also sets the bar. Getting a product out there, even if its a
crappy implementation, is better than no implementation. It&#8217;ll grow over time,
it just needs that time to do so. Some features might not be necessary, and some
that were overlooked might be that crucial thing users were looking for.
Building applications in a vacuum is bad for the developer and the users.</p>

<h2>The First Contract</h2>

<p>One of the first contracts I landed as a developer was a reservation system. I
had already built a similar system for an organization I was part of, so it felt
like it would be easy. Looking back, what was built with the timeline involved
was phenomenal. The main problem I continually ran into was a lack of
response from the client on some of the features. We hadn&#8217;t established a
minimum viable product, and there was no plan for how to address issues after
the launch of the application. This lead to a headache for both myself and the
client when trying to later implement the system.</p>

<p>If I was to rebuild that project I would get more involved in the client&#8217;s
implementation and ensure stronger communication. A section of a book I&#8217;m
currently reading (<a href="http://withouttheirpermission.com/">Without Their Permission: How the 21st Century will be made
not managed</a>) details how developers should
get into the industry they are attempting to innovate. I had spent over a year
handling the reservation and checkout of field and studio equipment, and then
built a system facilitate that online. Even with that knowledge I still should
have gone a step further with the second client. I should have picked up more
shifts checking in and out equipment and handling the reservation of it. I
should have done more exploratory exercises with the client, diving deeper into
the underlying issues.</p>

<p>Thing is, I&#8217;m getting a second shot at it. While the system I built has
seen its day and been retired for both the clients, the world still needs a
better way of reserving stuff. I looked long and hard for a
prepackaged solution to handle reserving things. Not a whole lot turned up. There
were some implementations, but they were usually tied to a specific CMS or
Framework, or they were standalone and cost a shitton of money.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t rocket science. It&#8217;s one of those problems that every implementation
solves specifically for their exact requirements. They aren&#8217;t pluggable, the
features of some are phenomenal, except they&#8217;re missing those one or two killer
features that make the system work for the specific client.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been toying around with the idea of building an open source reservation
system and API. The API is a big component. Making this system
pluggable into a large number of platforms will only aid in easy of use. The
other requirement is that it should have pluggable layers. Want to use Redis
instead of MySQL? That should not force you to rebuild the front end. Want to add a
open and closed hours for individual items or have them be part of a lab? Why
not both?</p>

<p>I took the first step. I created a repository last night,
and I plan on contributing something everyday. That&#8217;s the hard part, not
starting, but taking continual small steps. One foot in front of the other, day
by day. That&#8217;s how this will get done.</p>
