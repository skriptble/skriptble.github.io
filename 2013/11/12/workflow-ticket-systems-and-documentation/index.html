  <p>Today I was fixing a problem at work with one of the sites I&#8217;m the lead
developer on. The problem was a small and unfortunate QA error from a previous
release of the site. While I was preparing to send out an email to some other
team members to QA the site again I realized the only documentation of the
problem was scattered in emails and conversations. I thought I should perhaps
make a entry in the wiki. After a few moments of thinking, I came up with a
better solution.</p>

<h2>Self Documentation</h2>

<p>Self documenting makes sense. I see it as the best type of
documentation because it don&#8217;t require extra updating when the system evolves.
Even more, I enjoy being able to look through the history of a project and
figure out where something went wrong or when a certain implementation decision
was made. Writing self documenting code isn&#8217;t easy, and neither is documenting
what the code does as a whole. Comments help, but you still have to update them
when you update the code.</p>

<p>At work we have <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>, a popular issue tracking and project management
application made by Atlassian. We underutilize it, but we&#8217;ve been talking
recently about starting to use it efficiently. There are some workflow
problems, but that certainly isn&#8217;t unique to us. We have documentation in our wiki,
<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a>, but it doesn&#8217;t communicate with Jira.</p>

<p>While sitting at my desk, I decided to use Jira a tiny bit more, I created a
changelog and historical documentation. For the past
many months I&#8217;ve been using git to manage the sites I work on. I
use tags for production releases, making it simple to keep track of
what commit is currently in production. It also has the nifty benefit of giving
the site version numbers, which can be mapped in Jira and issues assigned to
those version numbers. I already have the workflow in place, it just doesn&#8217;t go
far enough.</p>

<p>Issues don&#8217;t have the same workflow. I get an email with something wrong
or someone walks into my office and tells me what&#8217;s wrong. Then I write some
code to fix it, make a commit without any reference to the problem just the
solution, and push it to staging. Then I message, email, or walk over and ask
someone to QA it. If it&#8217;s good, I package a release with a shiny new tag, push
it to Bitbucket, and pull it down onto production.</p>

<h2>The First Step</h2>

<p>Today, I created an issue in Jira, attached it to the versions
and components of the site affected, and used the comments in the ticket to
describe the solutions and communicate the QA phases and additional fixes.
Now this problem is documented for the foreseeable future.
If 5 months from now I wanted to know what was in this release,
I can view the issues and know what occurred.</p>

<p>This method of tracking not only allows us to have a solid system for following
issues that occur in the site, it also gives us documentation. We can
search through old tickets, and when we get Bitbucket hooked up to our Jira
instance, the goal would be to see git information directly in our issues.</p>

<p>This won&#8217;t replace traditional documentation. Until we can put in place a solid
testing architecture, better structured code, and write elegant
understand-while-reading-it code, we&#8217;ll need comments and wikis. I do wonder if
other developers don&#8217;t see the value in using time to write self documenting code
or commenting the code if you don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m hoping that I&#8217;m just arriving late to
the part instead of being one of the early birds.</p>
