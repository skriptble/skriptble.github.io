  <p>First day of work back from my trip out of town and my 1 year anniversary at my
current job and today I realized the downside to getting a refreshing breath of
air: I might have moved 10 steps forward, but no one else did.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2>Return to Reality</h2>

<p>I recognize this as the same feeling I had when I went back to work after a 4
day long conference. I had met new people, shared awesome ideas, and was
ready to start doing big things. All I got was a stack of unread emails and the
same problems I had before I left. These same problems blocked my big
ideas before I left.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Baby steps are the only way to get things done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leaving coworkers behind doesn&#8217;t help fix the problems, it does the
opposite. Once you&#8217;ve taken the 10 steps forward it&#8217;s hard to look back and walk
the steps back to help everyone else along. It&#8217;s difficult to find the patience
to hold people&#8217;s hand and guide them through the same steps you walked through.
This is exactly what needs to be done. Perhaps you&#8217;ll wind up taking the same
10 steps forward. More likely, you&#8217;ll have to reaffirm those 10 steps and
there will be a different path that is ultimately taken. It might not be ideal,
and usually comes with compromise, but it sets up a platform from which the
larger issues can be tackled.</p>

<p>It takes strength to get through those tough steps and come out the other side
still pushing for big ideas. It&#8217;s more difficult to adopt the
new ideas that you gained with those initial 10 steps. I still don&#8217;t
quite understand how to use TDD to build an actual application<sup>1</sup>. I&#8217;m having
trouble figuring out how to shift my mentality away from rebuilding everything
from scratch and instead updating the things I&#8217;ve been handed. It takes baby
steps. I need to starting putting tests into the projects I work on. It doesn&#8217;t
help that the testing framework in Drupal is particularly cumbersome, but the
tools we use shouldn&#8217;t be blockers. I should write unit tests anyway, even if
there are only one or two. I won&#8217;t become a better developer, tester, or writer
if I don&#8217;t develop, test, or write. One line, unit test, and word at a time is
what it takes.</p>

<h2>Just Start Walking</h2>

<p>I have a habit of waiting for the most opportune time to begin a task. I put
things off until I think I can get out of the gate with the best possible code
and the most well designed system. I add complexity where it doesn&#8217;t need to be.
A concrete example of this would be the Puppet configuration we&#8217;re attempting to
set up at work.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking we should have a registry that is able to
notify new servers as they spin up what type of server it should be.
We don&#8217;t need that functionality yet and it would be a better use of
time to simply create different images for the various types of servers. The
only difference between them would be the hostname and a few environmental
variables. This system would be completed quicker than trying to build a
registry and would accomplish the same task. I just need to punt the registry
down the road a little more until we are closer to needing it.</p>

<p>The registry is the ideal solution and gets the most bang for the buck, but
while we wait for me to build it, there is no new infrastructure. The system
doesn&#8217;t work and we have to deal with the large problems of the current system.
As hard as it is, I&#8217;ve decided to start walking and use the not so perfect
solution of various images. Ultimately, we might not even need the registry to
serve this purpose and the images could contain all the required functionality.</p>

<p>The important take away from that story is that the best way to accomplish a
task is to start walking. Not necessarily in the same idea as just getting
things done, but more in the idea of taking a step to get things moving. Not all
projects will be able to benefit from the just starting and for those this
method of implementing a step can help push things in the right direction.</p>

<p>In my post about <a href="/2013/11/19/content-management-with-mongodb">Content Management with
MongoDB</a> I mentioned
that the systems being demoed where built with a bunch of simple pieces that
added up to a more complex system. Each of those simple pieces is an individual
step, and figuring out how to collect those pieces and add them is a great way
to start.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still uncompressing the dose of perspective I got over this past weekend,
but this is definitely an insight from that uncompressing process. The
important thing is to keep moving, keeping taking steps, and keep processing things
as they uncompress.</p>

<p><small>1: I&#8217;m pulling some time travel here, but the reason for this is because
I&#8217;m using Drupal, which makes it difficult to use TDD. Which is one of the
driving factors in the next post on the Full Stack Engineering Meetup evolution
I had.</small></p>
