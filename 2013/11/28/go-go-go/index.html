  <p>Due to me recent evolutions I&#8217;m refocusing my development of my core. Instead of
focusing on PHP and Javascript, I&#8217;m shifting to Go. While Javascript and PHP are
necessary for immediate work, Go is a long term investment that will pay much
larger dividends in the end. The working knowledge I have of PHP and Javascript
will more than sustain me for the next few months.</p>

<h2>The First Few Steps</h2>

<p>After a suggestion from a fellow Drupaler to dive head first into Go, I have a
renewed energy for learning the language and incorporating it into my work. I&#8217;ve
had to do several systems tasks over the past few months and I&#8217;ve been using PHP
to accomplish them. My mentality then was that I was already investing so much
in this language, why not use it for as many things as possible. The problem
with that is the resources for accomplishing systems tasks with PHP isn&#8217;t what
PHP is commonly used for which means there isn&#8217;t a lot of community support for
that. Go is a completely different beast. I&#8217;ve only done a part of the <a href="http://tour.golang.org/">Go
tour</a> and I can already tell this language will be able
to tackle the problems I&#8217;ve been trying to solve with PHP in a much more elegant
way.</p>

<h3>What About PHP?</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m not abandoning PHP. I obviously will still use it at work, but I still see
value in using it for other projects. Not everyone I&#8217;ll work with will know Go,
which is why PHP is still in my core. With my new focus on being full stack,
using PHP as my primary language isn&#8217;t going to cut it.</p>

<p>The same goes for Drupal. Every toolbox needs a good set of tools that can
handle a variety of tasks at different levels. Some tools are for sketching out
ideas and others are for getting a large amount of work done quickly. PHP feels
more like the sketching tool and Go feels like the robust tool to get a large
amount of work done. Building prototypes in PHP and Drupal is fast. It would
also assist in shifting my mentality from trying to do things &#8216;The right way&#8217; in
Drupal. As I&#8217;ve said, there isn&#8217;t ever a &#8216;right&#8217; way to do something, just a
more correct way.</p>

<h2>Learning Go</h2>

<p>From the Go tour so far I am confident that I can learn Go without the use of
books, sticking strictly to the internet resources available. My knowledge level
of general programming principles is far different than it was a few months ago
so the basic introductory texts are pretty dry at this point. Tell me the
basics and let&#8217;s dive into some complex stuff.</p>

<p>That said, there is an interesting resource I did come across in my search for
learning material, an ebook that an internet book. For the most part I&#8217;ve
considered books things that one would purchase from a published, not so much
self published books, but how different are these things? In reality though, I
feel that the Go tour covers most if not all of what the book goes over.</p>

<p>Either way I&#8217;m excited to finally get a deeper dive into this language. I&#8217;ve
been itching to use something a bit more robust than PHP for a while so it&#8217;s
definitely going to be a great experience.</p>
