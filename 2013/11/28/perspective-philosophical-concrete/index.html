  <p>Today I discussed the realization and revelation from last night&#8217;s Meetup with a
coworker. He responded saying he was glad that I finally realized what he had
been telling me for weeks. Last night&#8217;s Meetup gave me the concrete actuality of
what, for a while, was only a philosophical goal.</p>

<h2>You Need Both</h2>

<p>My coworker has a point. He has big visions for our shop that shouldn&#8217;t be too
difficult to execute. I agree with him but I lacked the ability to take realize
that the magical tool I had come to love, Drupal, wasn&#8217;t the holy grail of everything
awesome. Drupal is that first relationship you have. You think it&#8217;s going to
last forever and wind up in marriage, but there are many more fish in the sea.
Even though it sucks, sometimes we just need to go out and explore. Maybe one
day the love will return, maybe not. Either way, Drupal is still going to be my
friend.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve broken up with Drupal, but it&#8217;s not a bad or messy break up. I just don&#8217;t
want to be in bed with Drupal anymore. I am a full stack engineer. I don&#8217;t work
on singular parts of the stack, I want to tinker, learn, and use everything.
Focusing on Drupal doesn&#8217;t allow me to do that.</p>

<p>The reason that my coworker&#8217;s ideas remained philosophical to me was because
Drupal couldn&#8217;t handle his request without overhauling significant built in
functionality. Since I was wildly in love with Drupal I tried continually to
figure out how to build the awesome things I wanted using the tool that I loved.
The problem is that many of the application engineering principles I learned
conflicted with how I wanted to build this new system. If we were attempting
to build a couple of sites, Drupal&#8217;s all in one system makes sense. If we were
building 200 sites that are all hosted in different places and are unrelated,
Drupal would make sense. We aren&#8217;t doing either of those things. We&#8217;re
building 200 sites that are completely related, intertwined, with a majority of
their functionality overlapping. In some instances, their content is
overlapping. Drupal isn&#8217;t built to handle this in an efficient way.</p>

<h2>We Want Phenomenal</h2>

<p>What we need are flexible tools that don&#8217;t case too much trouble or overhead.
The problem with Drupal is it works well for building a base system or
prototyping something. It can do a large number of things in a mediocre way. It
can manage your content, but it isn&#8217;t phenomenal at it. You can edit your
content, but it isn&#8217;t phenomenal at it. There is a lot of customization and you
can build crazy things on Drupal like e-commerce stores, reservation systems,
conference sites, publications, social networking applications, and more.
Drupal is phenomenal at being completely flexible.</p>

<p>This is a problem though. It is awesome when everyone is a great developer and
understands conventions. It is also awesome if your application only uses a few
contrib modules and the rest is your own custom code. Problem is, many Drupal sites
have a large number of contributed modules and some have that in addition to custom code.
I recently worked on a project where I essential had to hijack the theme system
to get a theme template into my module. I realized I could hijack the entire
theme system in a module and if I came back to the code 6 months from now I
could easily spend 3 weeks trying to figure out what the heck is going on. In
Drupal you can essentially do anything, anywhere.</p>

<p>This means that Drupal is phenomenally flexible but not a lot more. Sure,
you can add contrib modules to get the functionality you want. Sometimes just
the basic functionality takes contrib modules, which means you introduce this
black box into your code which could be hijacking and blowing up all sorts of
systems. In general they don&#8217;t, but I have definitely encountered it enough times
to give me pause.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re trying to build a number of applications that each do one thing and do it
phenomenally. This could be accomplished with a large number of Drupal sites,
but I find myself questioning the use of a non-unit testable, difficult to
cache, procedural application framework that boots an entire theme system even
if you&#8217;re only spitting out JSON.</p>

<h2>Philosophical &amp; Concrete</h2>

<p>After all this I&#8217;ve finally realized that Drupal isn&#8217;t the end tool, it&#8217;s the
beginning tool. There are other systems that can be built that will better
handle the requirements we have. The main issue with using Drupal our shop
is that we have 4 developers, a system administrator, and two designers.
We have complete control over every aspect of our stack from the bare metal to
the HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Our sites are essentially the same boilerplate
with different content placed in.</p>

<p>If we were forced to use a specific platform or set of tools, Drupal would
probably be more appealing. With the amount of customization we&#8217;ll have to do to
Drupal, arguments of portability are moot. Writing tests for Drupal
isn&#8217;t fun, and since it creates a new Drupal install for each test, you can&#8217;t
test with live data. Not that that&#8217;s a deal breaker, but simpletest is so slow
it isn&#8217;t practical to use TDD. Without TDD, we&#8217;re already starting out of the
gate with a huge disadvantage and asking for trouble quickly.</p>

<p>I needed this concrete explanation of why Drupal didn&#8217;t feel right. It needed to
come from someone that knew Drupal at an intimate level, more than I do. I
needed to understand that the feelings I had weren&#8217;t unjustified or wrong. I
needed to know I wasn&#8217;t crazy for wanting to break up with Drupal and just be
friends. I&#8217;m happy that my coworker and I are on the same page now, and I look
forward to building things without feeling like I have Drupal looking over my
shoulder, disapproving my use of another framework or technology.</p>
