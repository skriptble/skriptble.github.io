  <p>I have a Barnes and Noble membership and every so often I get these nifty
coupons that give me an extra 20% off. I didn&#8217;t use these for the first few
months I got them, but then I realized how important learning is to my career
and decided that every time I got a coupon I would go buy a book. A few days ago
I got one of those coupons, and today I decided to pick up a book that I&#8217;ve been
eyeing for a while on a topic I&#8217;ve been eyeing for a while: <a href="http://www.manning.com/pharrington/">Machine
Learning</a></p>

<h2>Automation &amp; Machine Learning</h2>

<p>I enjoy automating processes. I recognize that I am not efficient at doing
repetitive tasks; I am efficient at automating repetitive tasks.
Even if things only need to be done once or twice, automating it forces a
different way to think about the task at hand. It requires code and data that a
machine can read. Property names are standardized instead of using in the moment
random names. Changing these naming schemas requires more before-thought, so
they need to be designed with flexibility in mind. Having this flexibility helps
the system as a whole.</p>

<p>Blend some crafty regular expressions with some code generating templates,
sprinkle with a few well crafted shell scripts, or use a single application for
making large batches. Bake for an hour and serve automation while warm.
No need for external documentation, that stuff gets moldy real quick.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently reworking an internal system at work used for people profiles.
Instead of simply rebuilding what was already there I decided to do some refactoring as I went along.
Knowing that this suite of modules would be used all over the place I decided to make it
easy for our Drupal framework to be able to handle most of the tasks itself.
Eventually, we want to have an ecosystem of applications that push updates to
profiles out too all the sites that have that profile in real time.
The sites themselves would know how to handle or retrieve the data, enabling us
to do manual updates if need be.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten too deep into this profile system before this project. The most
work I had done was to grab the data being spit out and process it through
Drupal, ensuring it was output and formatted correctly. The more I view the
data we&#8217;re dealing with and hear about different enhancements that are requested,
the more I realize that machine learning will be handy now and essential in the
future.</p>

<p>Aside from that I see other uses for machine learning, such as analyzing our
logs to determine when trouble might be heading our way, or determining when the
application needs to scale and which layers need to scale.</p>

<p>I could have a very wrong interpretation of what can be done with machine
learning but I think these tasks can be accomplished with it. By automating all
these things I can get back to focusing on building awesome applications. I consider
this a valuable skill to have in my toolbox, but part of me wonders if I&#8217;ll be
able to fit another language in there.</p>

<h2>6 Core Languages</h2>

<p>I recently set a goal for myself of learning 6 core languages, most of which are
different types: 2 object oriented, 1 functional, and 3 system. Categories
aside, there is definitely overlap in concepts between the languages. Anyway, I wasn&#8217;t
planning on shoving Python in there. That said, machine learning
is definitely an important skill to have. This will require more thought.</p>

<p>In the end I know I will use machine learning here and there and the likelihood of
encountering Python in the wild is high. I will definitely be posting about those 6 core
languages too.</p>
