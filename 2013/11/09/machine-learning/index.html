  <p>I have a Barnes and Noble membership and every so often I get these nifty
coupons that give me an extra 20% off. I didn&#8217;t use these for the first few
months I got them, but then I realized how important learning is to my career
and decided that every time I got a coupon I would go buy a book. A few days ago
I got one of those coupons, and today I decided to pick up a book that I&#8217;ve been
eyeing for a while on a topic I&#8217;ve been eyeing for a while: <a href="http://www.manning.com/pharrington/">Machine
Learning</a></p>

<p>I enjoy automating processes. I recognize that I am not efficient at doing
repetitive tasks. I am efficient at writing things that do other things for me.
Even if I only have to do things once or twice, when you automate it you start
to think about the task at hand differently. You begin to structure your data
some a machine can understand it. Instead of using slightly different property
names you find a way to standardize them. You create some crafty regular
expressions, add a few code generating templates, and bam you&#8217;ve got some nice
automation going on.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently reworking an internal system at work we use to run the profiles
for various types of people in the university. Instead of simply rebuilding what
was already there (the goal was to migrate some of the heavy lifting into the
web framework layer) I decided to do some refactoring as I went along. Knowing
that this suite of modules would be used all over the place I decided to make it
easy for our framework (Drupal) to be able to handle most of the tasks itself,
the eventual goal of having a system that fires off several sites when an update
occurs. Those sites would know how to update the data on their own, no manual
configuring each site to do anything.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten too deep into this profile system before this project. The most
work I had done was to grab the data I was handed and process it through the
Drupal system and ensure that it is spit out onto the page. The more I view the
data we&#8217;re dealing with and hear about different enhancements that are requested
to this system, the more I realize that machine learning could be handy here.</p>

<p>Aside from that I see other uses for machine learning, such as analyzing our
logs to determine when trouble might be heading our way, or determining when the
application needs to scale and which layer needs to scale.</p>

<p>I could have a very wrong interpretation of what can be done with machine
learning but I think these tasks can be accomplished with it. By automating all
these things I can get back to focusing on building applications. I consider
this a valuable skill to have in my toolbox, but part of me wonders if I&#8217;ll be
able to fit another language in there.</p>

<h3>6 Core Languages</h3>

<p>I recently set a goal for myself of learning 6 core languages, most of which are
different types: 2 object oriented, 1 functional, and 3 system. While those are
the categories, I definitely see more overlap between them. Anyway, I wasn&#8217;t
planning on shoving python in there. However, as stated above, machine learning
is definitely an important skill to have. This will require more thought.</p>

<p>Anyway, in the end I know I&#8217;ll wind up using machine learning here and there,
and I&#8217;m bound to encounter some python in the wild so some experience with it
won&#8217;t do me too much damage. I&#8217;ll definitely keep posting about those 6 core
languages too.</p>
