  <p>Updating infrastructure is difficult. Especially when you want to move from an
old paradigm of manual everything to automated everything. Configuration
Management is something I&#8217;ve been hearing about more and more, but I haven&#8217;t had
a chance to dig into it. With the go ahead to build some new infrastructure,
I&#8217;m now diving deep into Puppet.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I dislike idealogical fights over tools. The process I try to follow is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine what is needed</li>
<li>Research and decide which tool best meets those needs.</li>
<li>Choose one.</li>
<li>If the one you picked doesn&#8217;t work, try another.</li>
<li>Repeat until you&#8217;ve either exhausted all the options or found one that works.</li>
</ol>

<p>I enjoy diving into things and getting stuff done, but there&#8217;s a reason why
determining needs is the first step. It&#8217;s important to know what&#8217;s needed,
this is the time to design the system that suits the situation best.
Things don&#8217;t move forward if there is a reliance on the tools that
exist and their capabilities determine the needs. After it&#8217;s been
determined what&#8217;s needed, then the available tools are evaluated. If nothing
fits the lowest end of the criteria, either build something new
or make compromises. Keep those initial needs somewhere important because
products grow and suggestions are usually welcome (especially in open source
projects).</p>

<p>I did this evaluation and figured out I have resources to learn puppet and
it would work with the infrastructure we choose. If puppet doesn&#8217;t work, we&#8217;ll
give Chef a try and then pick between the two.</p>

<h2>Learning Resources</h2>

<p>One of the factors in the decision to use Puppet was the available
resources for to learn it. I have an account on Tutsplus
and a few months ago they made the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/puppet-3-beginners-guide/book">Puppet 3 Beginner&#8217;s
Guide</a> available as a
free download for anyone with an account. If the book had been a Chef book
instead, Chef might be in the title of this post instead.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gotten halfway through the book and I&#8217;m excited to get
started with a real project. The book focuses on using practical examples and
walking through the thought process of a beginner. It gives a fair survey of the
landscape as well. It&#8217;s a great book for a beginner.</p>

<p>An example of this is a section which discusses distributing manifests. Instead
of a Puppet Master, the book suggests using Git. This is useful on more than one
front because most devops will most likely be using git. Using a tool that will be
useful in other areas, instead of a proprietary tool, is useful, even if readers
end of using a Puppet Master instead of Git to distribute the manifests.</p>

<h2>Don&#8217;t Take Shortcuts</h2>

<p>This is a big one. Sometimes I&#8217;ll work on a project and near completion, only to
rush it. It always winds up ruining the progress of the project, and the
outcome is usually more work to get things right or a thing that doesn&#8217;t do
what it was supposed to. Same goes for configuration management and
managing everything as code. It&#8217;s important not to cheat. Once you trigger that
configuration management tool, you shouldn&#8217;t be doing anything by hand that
isn&#8217;t in a git repository or stored elsewhere. Don&#8217;t install shiny new packages
by hand, use the configuration management tool.</p>

<p>It can be annoying and time consuming to hunt down bugs caused because one
package was installed by hand and deploying the system breaks everything. The
couple of extra seconds it takes to do it in an uncomfortable tool is well worth
it. Not only does this help keep the debugging time down later, the more you use
a new tool the more adept you&#8217;ll become with using it.</p>

<h3>Story Time: GIT</h3>

<p>When I was starting to get into advanced git usage, I started using my GUI
client as a crutch because I didn&#8217;t want to spend the time to look up the
command to do what I wanted. I wasted time getting the
repository onto my computer just to update it with Sourcetree. One day I decided
enough was enough and actually figured out how to accomplish the task<sup>1</sup>.
Now every time I need to do that task, I can type a few keystrokes and it&#8217;s
done. No more clone, modify, push cycle necessary.</p>

<p>Ultimately, writing everything as code is something that you have to decide if
you want to commit to. If you&#8217;re not going to commit 100% to it, just set the
boundaries. Know which situations you&#8217;ll want to use everything as code in and
which you don&#8217;t. There is nothing wrong with that. There is something wrong with
doing ad hoc everything and having no plan.</p>

<p><small>1: The actual task was selecting certain lines to commit. Using git add
-p doesn&#8217;t work because it will only break a chunk down so far.</small></p>
