  <p>Even though I&#8217;m not focusing on NodeJS at the moment, it is part of my core (via
Javascript). When a meetup about authentication for NodeJS popped up in the
suggested meetups I might want to attend I signed up right away. So here are
some notes I gathered over the course of the meetup.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I&#8217;ve used NodeJS before. I understand how to build an application with it and
the asynchronous nature of the framework. There are several applications out
there using NodeJS in production, even though it doesn&#8217;t have that shiny 1.0
release yet. It feels as though NodeJS is a nice fit between the functional
nature of Erlang and the procedural and object oriented feel of PHP.</p>

<h2>The Meetup</h2>

<p>There is nothing more encouraging than a group of excited developers talking
about something they all love. I had a rather negative experience with the PHP
meetup in town, but this meetup was energetic and the topic was engaging. The
presenter did well, he wasn&#8217;t an ace NodeJS developer, but I think that brings a
certain level of relief to a crowd. When there&#8217;s an ace developer presenting,
sometimes they move too fast or it&#8217;s difficult to understand the
concepts. The assume knowledge that comes as a given to them but is foreign to
others. That wasn&#8217;t my experience at all.</p>

<p>The topic was authentication, and the presenter brought up and interesting
topic: people do it wrong, a lot. The examples for attempting to do it correctly
are scattered in a messy pile with the examples of wrong. Most authentication
systems work like magic to me. I don&#8217;t general think about them and leave it to
the framework I&#8217;m using to handle it.</p>

<p>There are simple things one can do to protect their users though. I think one of
them is something that I run into quite often when logging into servers:
passphrases. When I SSH into a remote server to do work or develop, I don&#8217;t use
a password. I have an SSH public private key pair with a passphrase. The use of
a phrase instead of a password is more secure by itself, the extra layer of
public private keypair is the extra layer of protection that makes it awesome.</p>

<p>I believe this has been floating around on the internet for a while. Using a
sentence with spaces instead of a password. Sure, the usage of uppercase,
lowercase, numbers, and punctuation makes a password more secure, but having a
30 character long passphrase with uppercase, lowercase, spaces, numbers, and
punctuation is much better.</p>

<p>Imagine a world in which everyone&#8217;s authentication relied on a 35 character long
sentence. Perhaps with a mobile app, you log in with it once, and then you
assign a numeric code to unlock just that app. Or use phone or email for two
factor authentication. It&#8217;s time to stop using the &#8220;please enter a password
between 5 and 14 characters in length&#8221; systems and update to something more
secure and easier for regular people to remember.</p>

<p>Aside from that revelation, I networked with some people. Exchanged some
business cards, and I&#8217;ve ultimately decided to continue attending events like
these. Being surrounded by a bunch of motivated, excited developers will
definitely help advance my journey to mastering my core. The enthusiasm I
received from the people I networked with, and just being able to talk at the
same level was uplifting. I even managed to explain a concept to someone that
they had never heard of. This is definitely a group I need to be a part of.</p>
