  <p>Content is the most important thing on the web. Without it, all the javascript,
css, and shiny wouldn&#8217;t mean a thing. It doesn&#8217;t matter what backend system you
use, whether it&#8217;s PHP, Java, .NET, Ruby, Python, or Node.js. Without content,
they have nothing to serve. The storage of this content is just as important as
the content itself, so perhaps it&#8217;s time to come up with a new method for
storing it.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>When I first started doing web development, I had absolutely no idea how the
technologies that powered it worked. I understood what HTML and CSS were, but
things like PHP and MySQL baffled me. Eventually I did learn them and MySQL all
of the sudden became this awesome thing I felt like I store anything in.</p>

<p>Once I started to work on the web more and develop my skills I quickly realized
that building custom tables and designing the database was less fun when you
encountered larger problems. That&#8217;s when I discovered Content Management
Systems, specially Wordpress, Joomla, and Drupal. These systems took the work of
figuring out how to store data. They had nice GUI interfaces to build out the
content model and add new fields like images and taxonomy.</p>

<p>Now that I&#8217;ve been working in the web for a couple of years, I&#8217;ve begun to
realize that using MySQL to store content is like writing your term paper in
excel and having the professor compile all the papers into a massive excel file
for grading and storage. Then we build a shiny Word interface on top of it. But
the content is still being stored as an excel file. It worked though, so we used
what we had.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve taken it too far. Now we throw quite a bit of effort into scaling this
system and throwing things in front of it to make it run faster (hello varnish).
It seems we&#8217;ve forgotten something important. The most important thing about the
web: the content. We&#8217;ve been focusing on making our content work for this
technology that doesn&#8217;t really suit it. MySQL, like Excel, isn&#8217;t a bad piece of
technology, it&#8217;s actually an amazing piece of technology, just not for storing
content. We write papers in Word for a reason.</p>

<p>Sometimes the tools we use for one task match up pretty well for another task.
In this case the same tools I use everyday to write code also fit well for
storing content. Content shouldn&#8217;t exist associated directly to a page. It
should be a singular unit of information, regardless of the eventual display
format. We should have a history of our content. Different people should be able
to work on the same content at the same time and be able to merge their changes.
Our content should be easy to backup and safeguard, and it shouldn&#8217;t care about
being stored in a specific format. It should be indexable.</p>

<p>I propose a new system. One that uses git for the content storage and history
tracking and a document store for representation of the content. The document
store should also be able to index the content and it&#8217;s associated metadata. The
system we use should be able to read the content from the git version controlled
files into the document store. The content interface should be focused on
collecting atomic units of content. The page paradigm doesn&#8217;t fit the web. Our
pages are beginning to melt away, the use of technologies like pjax and spa
(single page applications) is melting away the page refresh. Our content
assembling system should be able to not only compile the content together, but
actually relate the content. Google does this with ads, you visit a site and
then bam, that site&#8217;s ads are on every other site because of google&#8217;s ad
network. Advertising has found a way to make this work, but the web is not
about advertising . The web is about content.</p>

<p>We need to take this powerful technology and apply it to aspects of the web that
help people. I&#8217;m not talking about corporate websites, the Apple websites of the
world are doing just fine. It&#8217;s a common joke that the only thing that&#8217;s on a
university&#8217;s homepage that the user actually needs is the name of the
university. This problem reaches beyond universities to almost all non-profits.
I think this comes from a fundamental misunderstanding that non-profits and
university&#8217;s have that the private for-profit companies certainly do not. The
universities and non-profits see the web as secondary. It&#8217;s just a side benefit,
not the focus of funds or dedicated attention. Like many things, they often try
to get it on the cheap and get it done fast. There&#8217;s a core problem with this
thinking, and it lies in the actual cost financially.</p>

<p>I completely understand that non-profits don&#8217;t usually have a large amount of
funding and that they wish to tackle the core of the problem they&#8217;re trying to
solve. The problem comes in when the actual cost of a cheaply made website comes
in. I&#8217;ve seen a number of these websites take twice as long if not more to
administrate. If we&#8217;re talking about a web application used by everyone in the
company, the amount of time you waste is most likely even more.</p>

<p>Then, in the end, as with one of my recent projects, you higher a more expensive
web developer to fix up whatever it was that was broken. If the company had just
gone with the second developer in the first place it would have cost the same,
but they wouldn&#8217;t have had to pay for the first web developer&#8217;s botch and the
additional time wasted by their employees.</p>

<p>Of course this doesn&#8217;t apply to all non-profits and it has really just been my
personal observation. Conversations with other developers have led me to believe
I&#8217;m not the only one that sees it.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the solution? A number of small improvements to what we use to build
sites and web applications. It starts with the most important thing on the web:
the content. So let&#8217;s build a better content storage and delivery system. One
that you can use with PHP, Ruby, Python, .NET, NodeJS, Java, or any other
backend. It&#8217;s time we all start helping each other in as many ways as possible.</p>

<p>There is plenty of web for everyone, I assure you that.</p>
