  <p>There are a large number of professions out there where you have to practice
before you can perform. Musicians do it, as do artists, writers, and chefs. You
wouldn&#8217;t be too happy if a chef decided to try out a new recipe for your meal
and they had never cooked it before. A writer wouldn&#8217;t hand the first copy of a
screen play or manuscript to a publisher or a studio. Artists certain draw,
paint, or sculpt more than once before they create their final product for
showing. Musicians practice for years, they don&#8217;t get up on stage in a symphony
having never played their music before. These professions pay varying amounts of
money, but software development makes more than several of these. Why is it
okay, in our industry, to not practice?</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>This idea isn&#8217;t uniquely mine or something new. I&#8217;ve been reading <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate
Programmer</a>, it&#8217;s a
good book, if you haven&#8217;t read it I suggest you pick it up and give it a read.
One of the chapters is called &#8220;Practice, Practice, Practice&#8221; and it definitely
resonated with me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve read other books that mention practicing, but it didn&#8217;t really click until
I read that chapter. We build important software for the world, and so many of
us don&#8217;t take the time to sharpen our skills outside of in the moment we&#8217;re
developing an application.</p>

<p>I witness the lack of practice everyday, in my own work and in other&#8217;s work. I
am lucky enough to be able to squeeze in time to prototype projects at work that
helps really learn about the platforms I work with. I&#8217;m starting to realize the
true potential I have if I did practice, though. Even for an hour a day, playing
around with regular expressions, figuring out how to use a new feature in PHP, or
even trying to integrate two systems together like using PHP and Redis.</p>

<p>Learning a new language here or there would also help. I already see some of the
javascript paradigms I use flowing into the PHP I write. This is mostly because
PHP has closures in it now. I definitely see how other features of PHP like the
Reflection API and DOMDocument could be extremely useful tools have to
available.</p>

<p>I think one of the biggest ones that I fail to practice is regular expressions.
Almost weekly I have some use case for using a regex to solve a problem, but
because I can&#8217;t read or write them very well I default to doing funky looking
string manipulation. It&#8217;s ugly to look at, not fun to follow along with, and it
gets clunky quickly.</p>

<p>This also feeds into another thing I&#8217;ve discovered recently. Many times I&#8217;ll
hear people use &#8220;developer&#8221; and &#8220;programmer&#8221; or &#8220;coder&#8221; interchangeably. I don&#8217;t
believe these two things mean the same thing. A programmer or coder is someone
who knows how to write code in a language to get something done. They might only
know one language, and even if they know a few they probably only know languages
that are similar, such as C based languages. Developers, on the other hand, are
people who create solutions using tools available to them. It could be a
combination of programming languages and other technologies. I think a great
developer knows a few different languages in a few different families, so an
object oriented language or two and a functional language. There&#8217;s a huge
difference there, even on the language part.</p>

<p>Knowing multiple languages puts you at an advantage, because it changes the way
you approach problems. I&#8217;ve had the occasion to look at someone&#8217;s code and think
to myself &#8220;this was definitely written by an old school PHP developer&#8221;. It&#8217;s not
a bad thing necessarily, but from my (short) experience I&#8217;ve noticed that that
style of code is coupled with not knowing the newer conventions of the language.
I&#8217;ve worked with someone who wrote a JSON encoding function in PHP because they
didn&#8217;t know one was built into the language.</p>

<p>Practicing and learning go hang in hand. If you practice, you&#8217;ll learn. If you
learn and apply that learning, you&#8217;ve done some practice. That&#8217;s really what
keeps me on the edge of things; the amount of time I sink into reading up on new
technologies and learning things.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;ve seen thus far is that all that learning I did before is really
beginning to pay off. I&#8217;ve been working on a project for a few days now, and
I&#8217;ve been able to develop the prototype quickly. I shouldn&#8217;t really call it a
prototype because it will most likely be going into production. It can only do
that because I&#8217;m confident that the tools I&#8217;m using to assemble it are solid. I
understand how they work, if they blow up I know how to fix them, where the
problem it. The new system is actually powered on MongoDB, which looking back
I&#8217;ve been practicing and learning about for the past 7 months.</p>

<p>What matters is that you find the way that practicing works for you. If it&#8217;s
reading blogs and trying out some of the projects, go for it. If it&#8217;s sitting
down with a book and hacking on the examples, more power to you. If it&#8217;s reading
the documentation site or just throwing random API parts of the API together to
see what you get, then do that. Do what makes you refine your skills and makes
you a better developer.</p>
