  <p>One of the most annoying things I have to do while I continue to set up my new
computer is carry two of them around at the same time. Like when implementing a
new system sometimes you must keep the old system up and running while you
migrate to the new system. I will need a few days of having both before I can
retire my original WebDevBook.</p>

<h2>Analogies A Plenty</h2>

<p>One of the things I think is unique about the way I think is how I see things
connecting together. Like many things, it&#8217;s a double edged sword, it has the
benefit of allowing me to predict what will happen, but it also means I get
carried away at times. Sometimes the connections are obvious and other times
they are obscure.</p>

<p>The analogy I see with my current situation is one I definitely need to take
into consideration when deploying new systems and applications. Dropping one
system and then picking up another the next day is asking for a disaster. There
isn&#8217;t any escaping it, both systems must be kept up at the same time, while the
old system is slowly phased out.</p>

<p>The new infrastructure at work is aiming to do this in an elegant way.
Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t exactly feel as if that will be the ultimate end
result. There might be a simple flip of a switch and off goes one set of
infrastructure and on goes the new shiny.</p>

<p>With websites, this is definitely how things usually happen. There is the launch
of the new site, and the old site is taken down. Sometimes there are certain
pieces of functionality that remain on the old system while newer pieces are
added or upgraded. This is a nice hybrid approach to the problem.</p>

<h2>Constructing Compatible Systems</h2>

<p>One of the difficult problems of having two systems that handle the same task,
running at the same typing is having the information from one system added
to the secondary one, specifically, information from the old system being
ported into the new. Sometimes it seems easier to just drop one system and bring
up the other one to eliminate this problem, but there are other issues with
that.</p>

<p>Building compatibility between the two systems isn&#8217;t always easy. Sometimes it
seems nearly impossible or estimates indicate it will take too much time to
accomplish. Even with the barriers, having the ability to pull in data from the
old system will surely be needed, so adding the functionality to continually run
that process shouldn&#8217;t be too much to ask.</p>

<p>While it won&#8217;t help with old systems, when designing a new system it could help
to design the data agnostic from the system that runs it. A strong data
structure makes the information easier to move around. For instance, I use JSON
to storing information at times. The great thing about JSON is that if we
dropped PHP tomorrow and started using Ruby, we would easily be able to ready in
data that was structured for JSON.</p>

<p>I am glad that I have the ability to use the two WebDev books as a migration
test, because moving from one machine to another is going to be easier than
shifting from one set of infrastructure to another. There will be a lot of sweat
and tears throughout both of these processes, but at the end of the day if
enough time and care is taken, the process will overall go smoothly.</p>
