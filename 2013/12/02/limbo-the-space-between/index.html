  <p>One of the most annoying things I have to do while I continue to set up my new
computer is carry two around at the same time. Like when implementing a
new system sometimes you should keep the old system running while the migration
occurs. I will need a few days of having both before I can retire my original
WebDevBook.</p>

<h2>Analogies A Plenty</h2>

<p>One of the things that is unique about the way I think is how I see connections.
Like many things, it&#8217;s a double edged sword, it has the
benefit of allowing me to predict what will happen, but it also means I get
carried away at times. Sometimes the connections are obvious and other times
they are obscure.</p>

<p>The analogy I see with my current situation is one I need to take
into consideration when deploying new systems and applications. Dropping one
system and picking up another the next day is asking for a disaster. There
isn&#8217;t any escaping it, both systems must be kept up at the same time. Then the
old system is slowly phased out.</p>

<p>The new infrastructure at work is aiming to do this in an elegant way.
Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t exactly feel as if that will be the ultimate end
result. There might be a simple flip of a switch and off goes one set of
infrastructure and on goes the new shiny.</p>

<p>With websites, this usually happens. There is the launch
of the new site, and the old site is taken down. Sometimes there are certain
pieces of functionality that remain on the old system while newer pieces are
added or upgraded, but I haven&#8217;t seen this occur often.</p>

<h2>Constructing Compatible Systems</h2>

<p>One of the difficult problems of having two systems that handle the same task,
running at the same time is having the information from one system added
to the secondary one, specifically, information from the old system being
migrated into the new. It would be easier to do a switch, but I haven&#8217;t been
saying it&#8217;s a bad idea for no reason.</p>

<p>Building compatibility between the two systems isn&#8217;t easy. It
seems impossible or estimates indicate it will take too much time to
accomplish. Even with the barriers, having the ability to pull in data from the
old system will be necessary, so adding the functionality to continually run
that process isn&#8217;t much to ask.</p>

<p>While it won&#8217;t help with old systems, when designing a new system it could help
to design the data agnostic from the system that runs it. A strong data
structure makes the information easier to move around. For instance, I use JSON
to storing information with some systems. The great thing about JSON is that if we
dropped PHP tomorrow and started using Ruby, we would easily be able to read in
that data.</p>

<p>I am glad that I have the ability to use the two WebDev books as a migration
test, because moving from one machine to another is going to be easier than
shifting from one set of infrastructure to another. I don&#8217;t see any tears or
too much sweat involved in this process, just a lot of critical thinking and
designing planning. I know it will definitely be a great experience.</p>
