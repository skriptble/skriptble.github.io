  <p>One of my closest friends loves living in the city but is actively trying to
move out. It&#8217;s already set in stone, she&#8217;s moving out at the beginning of next
year and sad as I am, I understand why. Sometimes a break is needed. Some time
to slow down and evaluate things. I&#8217;ve been cruising along at hyperspeed for the
past year and it&#8217;s time to do some reflecting.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I&#8217;ve been writing a blog post every day for almost a month now. I&#8217;m sure some of
what I&#8217;ve written is repetitive, and I&#8217;m sure what I write in the future will be
as well. I&#8217;ve read a couple times in books I can&#8217;t remember that the best way to
see how much you&#8217;ve grown is to write it down. Keeping a history of code and
writing a blog are two fine ways to do this. I&#8217;m sure in a year when I look back
at all I&#8217;ve written these first posts will remind me how much I&#8217;ve learned and
how much more I can learn. Problems that feel impossible today will feel simple
later. That&#8217;s certainly how I feel about the things I&#8217;ve done since I wrote my
first web application.</p>

<p>Even this past month has been crazy. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I would be able to keep up
with posting everyday, but I&#8217;ve managed to be dedicated enough to do it. That
said, just like my friend, I feel like everything is extremely fast. I feel like
my life is flashing before my eyes as the days melt into months. My reaction to
that is different and the catalyst for the shift into hyperspeed is also
different.</p>

<h2>Setting Goals and Moving Forward</h2>

<p>A couple months ago I wouldn&#8217;t have said my life is moving at hyperspeed. Things
were going by quickly, and I was excited, but I didn&#8217;t have any long term goals
except for the ultimate ones. I had my impossible right now goals, but no
intermediate goals to move toward. I had no core, in fact I was only interested
in mastering PHP and possibly Javascript. I was PHP crazy, I wanted to do every
part of the entire workflow at work with PHP. I wanted to use Drupal for
everything. There were even times when I wondered why everyone didn&#8217;t use
Drupal. My relationship with Drupal was solid and there were no doubts.</p>

<p>I was happy. At least I thought I was. I was happily pretending that the life I
was living was the life for me. It was actually the life for someone else.
Someone who is okay with being complacent, with not pushing boundaries, and with
falling behind. I don&#8217;t go with the flow, I make the flow. As can be expected
things deteriorated fast, which is how I wound up 80 blocks up town, in a quite
neighborhood, writing blog posts every day. For measure, I attempted to post
everyday back in August. It didn&#8217;t work out so well, I never even got the blog
up and running and after a couple days I started skipping posts.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until after the move that I realized that I didn&#8217;t want to be in the
city anymore. It didn&#8217;t fuel me to achieve using my own steam. I needed a goal
to push me to slam the pedal to the floor. That goal is to move to the west
coast in a year. I gave myself between 12 and 18 months because I wanted to
finish up at my current job and take the time to find a job that&#8217;s a step up
from where I am now. I feel that the west coast might end up like the city with
me relying on my own steam to move forward and if that&#8217;s the case I&#8217;ll find a
new goal for a place to move to. I feel that I&#8217;ll have a better shot at finding
a group of people to keep each other going though. In a year I will also be in a
much better place to start my own shop, and the resources on the other coast
feel more abundant than over here. Ultimately I want to explore. The west coast
will be my home, but I definitely plan on traveling all over the place.</p>

<p>Post for 23 straight days gives me confidence that in a year I won&#8217;t be ready to
move on to the next thing, I&#8217;ll also have finished what I need to. I&#8217;ll be fully
prepared and eager to move on to the next thing. This blog will serve as a
record of what I&#8217;ve done and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be much better in the future because
my writing skills will have woken back up and improved. With a solid year of Go
on my belt, some masterful Javascript and PHP skills, with some solid Erlang and
C, it won&#8217;t be hard for me to take a step up. Even if that step is going out on
my own and building something that truly represents my skills.</p>
