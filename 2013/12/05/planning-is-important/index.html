  <p>I did something silly. I forgot to plan. This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve
done it either, for some reason I think that whatever planning I do in my head
will suffice and I just plow along. It&#8217;s time to stop being silly and start
writing things down.</p>

<h2>The Writer Who Forgets To Write</h2>

<p>I have a bad habit of doing this. I come up with great ideas and don&#8217;t write
them down. I come up with awful ideas and I don&#8217;t write those down either. I
should go turn in my writer card and call it a day. I won&#8217;t get off
that easy though. I am writing this blog after all. This blog didn&#8217;t start
out as an easy thing to do either, the first time around I failed fantastically.
I&#8217;ve botched a couple projects, not because the ideas weren&#8217;t good or that they
didn&#8217;t have the drive behind them, but simply because I failed to plan and
constrain them. The scope creep ate up all the time and I didn&#8217;t discipline
myself enough to buckle down and work in a sane way.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had this problem where I don&#8217;t think I know enough to plan out a project. I
get carried away with the minor details and lose focus on the larger picture. I
haven&#8217;t had enough exposure to the planning process for projects. I&#8217;ve also
become highly focused on all the technical details of the things I work on. I&#8217;ve
begun combating this by focusing more of my time with theory and higher level
books.</p>

<h2>Life is Asynchronous</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, my brain does not enjoying operating in this fashion. I always
want to get to work on a problem and not stop until it&#8217;s completed. I have
trouble unfocusing and switching gears. This has led to entire days being taken
up with one task, which is an awful way for me to work. I would be able to
accomplish more if I could step away from a project and into another one. Perhaps
a good exercise would be to work in one hour increments. I need to break my
tasks down into smaller pieces, because trying to tackle a behemoth problem in
one fell swoop isn&#8217;t getting the job done.</p>

<p>One of the books I read suggested putting together a list of daily tasks. Ones
which could actually be completed in the span of a few hours. I need to start
doing this again. Todo lists have always felt like the bane of my existence but
this is definitely an area where having one could make a large impact on my
productivity.</p>

<p>Overall, the large problem I&#8217;m having is I want to learn too many things and I
feel so overwhelmed that I hyper focus on a single particular topic. When I had
meetings, classes, and squeezed homework and freelance work in around the edges,
I managed to get a whole lot more done. I couldn&#8217;t sit and focus on one issue,
slowly climbing my way deeper into the rabbit hole. The semester was a set
amount of time and there were hard deadlines to achieve goals. Missing a
deadline meant it might not get done for a number of months or never.
The stakes were higher. At work, I&#8217;m there 5 days a week. What I
don&#8217;t get done today can get done tomorrow, or next week, or next month.</p>

<h2>Something Inbetween</h2>

<p>I have small goals. I have huge goals. I don&#8217;t have anything connecting them at
the moment. I&#8217;m building a ladder with tens of thousands of toothpicks. Surely
it would be easier if I grabbed some 2x4s and other pieces of wood, a saw, and
fashioned myself workable materials. I need daily commitments of things to
get done. The only one I have right now is writing in this blog and doing daily
commits. I need more. That more needs to be something I can feel engaged in.
Something that excites me everyday. I want to come home and be excited to run
through my tasks. I want to feel like I&#8217;m living life again, because right now I
feel a little stuck.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to be pushing toward moving to the west coast, but at this rate
it&#8217;ll be more than a year before I feel ready. It would probably be two or
three. That&#8217;s not acceptable. I need to focus more and get to work.</p>

<p>That all goes back to the writing things down problem. I have ideas. Constantly.
When I write them down, I have more of them. The problem isn&#8217;t having ideas,
it&#8217;s executing them. Ideas, like code, are cheap. Sometimes there are
good ones and other times there are not so good ones. The real value is in
realizing what they can become. The real value comes from making them concrete.</p>
