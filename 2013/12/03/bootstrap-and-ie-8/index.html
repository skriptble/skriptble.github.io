  <p>I recently built an application at work for the HR department. A tight timeline
and busy queues required me to write the entire application from backend to front
end, by myself. To get things up and running I used Twitter Bootstrap.
Unfortunately, I forgot that we are still supporting Internet Explorer 8.</p>

<h2>Internet Explorer 8 Is Legacy</h2>

<p>Internet Explorer is an annoying browser to develop for. I don&#8217;t have to
support Firefox 10 or Chrome 19. Internet Explorer is in it&#8217;s own world, and
having to test and use it is annoying. I am thankful that it has developer
tools. Those tools actually saved me today when I was attempting to debug a form
on the site.</p>

<p>Internet Explorer 8 also doesn&#8217;t natively handle media queries. For bootstrap to
work you have to add respond.js, which doesn&#8217;t work without a proxy or local
bootstrap files. I was using a CDN that doesn&#8217;t have the proxy file set up. This
cost me a day to reconfigure the site to get off the CDN and start using
local files. It also adds maintenance costs for the future when newer
version of bootstrap come out. It was a lot of work for a single browser, but I
do feel better knowing the application is that much better because of it. Plus,
I was able to try out a shinier bootstrap theme.</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, all code is legacy and it&#8217;s important to plan in update
paths in the maintenance of the code. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find non-browser platforms
in the future that will have some of the same problems as Internet Explorer 8.</p>

<h2>Do Some Good While You&#8217;re At It</h2>

<p>As much as a lost day of working on the new infrastructure hurts, I&#8217;m glad I
took the time to not just fix the singular problem I ran into. By adding
respond.js and properly setting up the libraries I was able to make the
application and future user experience as a whole better. This small step
in the right direction is exactly the type of upgrades I talked about in
previous posts.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t anything huge, but I didn&#8217;t need to fix the problems I did. The
reported issues was only about 6 lines of CSS I added, but the value in having
an application that works properly across browsers means that I might have
lost a day today, but I&#8217;ll save more days and headaches in the future.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s these steps that encourage me to set goals, because I know that I
will find a way to take the small steps. Today it&#8217;s simply replacing a few small
components. The future might be replacing larger parts of legacy systems. Perhaps
we can manage to get to the point where people will barely remember of the days
of slow upgrades and twice a year releases of your favorite browser.</p>
