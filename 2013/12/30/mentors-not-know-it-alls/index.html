  <p>I&#8217;ve had many mentors over the past several years of my life. There is always
this feeling that one&#8217;s mentor knows all about the subject they mentor in. It&#8217;s
as if they have been given the great knowledge of everything. I&#8217;ve recently been
kicked out of this mirage though. I&#8217;ve started encountering areas where even the
people I consider my mentors and those I think highly of are wrong or not
forward thinking about for my tastes.</p>

<h1>They Help You Get Up</h1>

<p>A mentor&#8217;s role should be to help you get up and running until you can run
yourself. I&#8217;ve begun outgrowing people whom I consider my mentors and it&#8217;s
strange. Some mentors never fit well in the first place because there were too
many places where my knowledge was broader than theirs in the places I wanted to
be mentored.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m starting to realize that my ideas and the direction I want to take myself,
my career, and my life don&#8217;t align with theirs as much as they used to. I&#8217;m
seeing the same things occur at work. I enjoy work, but the work ethic and the
views are too old style for me. They are clearly from a different of thinking
that is far too inefficient and unproductive for me. Being in an office at 9am
on the dot, working a long day, then going home and not focusing on things
entirely different than work. This works fine if one doesn&#8217;t want to be pushing
any barriers. The opposite, strangely enough, is also unproductive, working all
hours of the day, always being in at work, and having perks like a gym, catered
food, and a plethora of games just make workers stay in the office longer. Work
takes up the space its given. The old model creates a static amount of time for
work to be done. The newer &#8216;startup&#8217; method allows an overly flexible amount of
time for work to be done. I built an application that is much more complex than
many of the things we build at work, and it took two weeks. We only had two
weeks, so we got it done in two weeks, and anything extra goes in another
project. Same thing with the infrastructure. I feel confident that if we needed
to, we could pick up and launch the big parts of the infrastructure tomorrow.
There are a few key areas missing, but that&#8217;s my fault for not thinking of them
until too late in the game.</p>

<p>After reading Rework and most of Remote, I realize that my way of thinking about
work isn&#8217;t some strange, silly way of working. It&#8217;s a method that works for a
large software development company with 36 employees. They bring in millions of
dollars with their methods. Our small team at work doesn&#8217;t bring in one. It has
little to do with the number of people and more to do with the actual work being
done. I have reservations about the direction things are heading in at work, but
I often feel as though if I speak up I&#8217;ll just be bogged down with so many
excuses of why the way we&#8217;re doing things is fine that I wind up flustered and
just give up out of frustration. The arguments always sound better in my head,
unfortunately. Sadly, the arguments in my head don&#8217;t anticipate for blatantly
ignoring the mistakes of others, massive stupidity, and a lack of desire to do
the most basic research. I could add these into my arguments, but what&#8217;s the
point in attempting to combat stupidity? I&#8217;ve never been good at it, I don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;m want to be good at it. Perhaps one day I will require that skill, I&#8217;m
just hoping that day never comes.</p>
