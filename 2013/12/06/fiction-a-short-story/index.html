  <p>So I haven&#8217;t written any fiction in a while so I&#8217;m gonna give it a shot.</p>

<p>Plot: After months of dealing with his best friend falling into bad habits, Ted
has become overly frustrated, even though he knows that Max has been working
hard to repair their friendship.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Bounce. Bounce. Bounce. The sound of the rubber ball slamming the floor. The
only noise I can hear right now. I clench my first in frustration. Another
letter. He&#8217;s done this to me so many times. I look up as I hear the sound of a
key in a lock. Just the TV. The thoughts race through my head, what am I going
to say to him? Where could he be this time? Why letters? Why printed? How is he
so damn functionally dysfunctional?</p>

<p>I slam the ball into the floor one more time before picking up the letter again.
I scam over the words, watching them melt together into a slurry of darkness.</p>

<pre><code>Ted,

I'm not coming back. Stop worrying about me. I'll be fine.

-Max
</code></pre>

<p>What makes him think this is the best way to go about things? I&#8217;ve spent so much
time helping him and this is how he repays me? I stand up and walk to the
kitchen. The orange juice feels good as it slides down my throat, chilling my
insides as my head gets hotter. I rinse out the glass, remembering how angry Max
always got when I left a little bit of dried juice on the bottom. I really
shouldn&#8217;t be this angry. I really should just let it go. He always comes back.</p>

<p>I sit down on the couch and start channel flipping. Homework. I should be doing
my homework. I could be doing homework. I&#8217;m not doing homework. The last thing I
can focus on right now is a literary theory essay. He always does this to me, I
wind up  getting so engrossed in worrying about him that I blow off my other
responsibilities.</p>

<p>I hear a knock at the door. It startles me a bit as I crash land back into
reality. I jump around a bit as I make my way to the door. I swing it open.
Jack stands in front of me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey. I forgot my keys. Sorry.&#8221;, he says. He tilts his head slightly to the
right, squinting his eyes while furrowing his brow. I lean in and kiss him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No problem. I was just day dreaming anyway.&#8221;, I say, &#8220;I honestly needed a
distraction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on babe, you have to stop thinking about him.&#8221;, he lets out a breath as
the words escape his mouth. He pauses for a few seconds as we stare emptily at
each other. He hugs me. I don&#8217;t hug back. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be like this. You can&#8217;t let him
ruin your life. Not again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I break out of his hug and walk back into the kitchen. The glass drying in the
rack has an orange oval on the bottom. Fuck. Max would care about
that, Jack doesn&#8217;t even know we have a kitchen. I take a deep breath. Time to
buck up.</p>

<p>&#8220;How was work?&#8221;, I ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Same old. Although there was this really weird guy who kept picking up books
and putting them back in random places&#8230;&#8221; His words drift away as I refocus on
the letter sitting on the coffee table. Where the hell is he.</p>

<p>&#8220;TED!&#8221;, Jack screams in my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;WHAT?!&#8221;, I scream back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you at least pretend to pay attention to me? I&#8217;m worried about you.&#8221;, he
tilts his head again, &#8220;You&#8217;re not handling this well. Maybe you should get
help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need help. It made it worse the last time.&#8221;, I shake my head at him as
the lie leaves my mouth. Talking to someone did help last time, but I want to
wallow in my sadness. Maybe if I do, I&#8217;ll remember the pain when he tries to
come back into my life.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead.&#8221;, Jack says. I lock eyes with him, &#8220;He&#8217;s dead to all of us. Monica.
You. Me. Sam. He&#8217;s left us. Move. On.&#8221;</p>

<p>I understand his words. I refuse to believe them. I refuse to believe anything
this ridiculous. Max is coming back, he&#8217;ll be here in the morning and he&#8217;ll
apologize to me and&#8212;</p>

<p>Jack slams his face into mine. Botched kiss as our foreheads collide.
We both fall over the back of the couch, my arms holding him tightly. Our legs
flail in the air as he kisses my neck.  I sit there, still thinking about the
possible places where Max could be. Jack bites me. Fuck it. I&#8217;m not letting Max
ruin this too.</p>

<p>I wake up abruptly. Jack&#8217;s arm is wrapped around my waist as we lie in bed. What
the fuck just happened? I turn around and face him. The blinking colon of the
alarm clock breaks my gaze at his peaceful face. 2:00 AM. I take a short breath,
kiss Jack on the forehead and walk out of our bedroom. I grab a glass out of the
drying rack, still has an orange ring on the bottom. Fuck it. The light from the
refrigerator blinds me as I feel around for the orange juice carton.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s on the counter.&#8221;, I hear a voice say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. Why are you up so late?&#8221;, I respond as I pour a full glass and put the
carton in the fridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Same reason as usual. Sam&#8217;s crying his eyes out.&#8221;, the voice says again,
&#8220;Jackie keeps punching things and calling me. Max needs to stop hurting people.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sit down next to Monica. Her mascara is smeared. Classic two weeks into a Max
disappearance. At least she isn&#8217;t crying alone for the whole night this time. I
put my arm around here.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to come back.&#8221;, I say. I should probably stop lying to people, &#8220;He
always does. Just don&#8217;t give him money this time&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy for you to say.&#8221;, Monica retorts. What the fuck is wrong with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Totally. My best friend of 20 years suddenly starts disappearing, coming back
home broke, and it&#8217;s easier for me than his one time girlfriend.&#8221;, I should be
more careful with my words, but they&#8217;re already out there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s me escalate this anymore. I don&#8217;t want Jack to come storming out here.&#8221;,
she smiles, &#8220;Unless he&#8217;s still sleeping naked&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lay off. He&#8217;s mine.&#8221;, I snap, &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised you didn&#8217;t bring something home
tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t stop thinking about him.&#8221;, she cackles, &#8220;His name is Tom, and he passed
out hours ago. He has a really nice&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s my queue. I&#8217;ll listen to your sexcapades in the morning.&#8221;, I stand
up and walk to the kitchen. I rinse out the glass as I speak, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s
wonderful. Don&#8217;t feel bad when I outpace you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I put the glass in the drying rack. Still a damn orange oval. I walk into my
bedroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodnight Monica.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodnight Ted.&#8221;</p>
