  <p>A couple weeks ago I wrote a post about how important planning is. I wrote about
the importance of writing things down and having the ability to switch gears.
Since this blog is evolving as I do, it&#8217;s apt that I write about how my views on
this subject has changed.</p>

<h1>Books and Opinions</h1>

<p>About a week and a half ago I picked up the books
<a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">Rework</a> and <a href="http://37signals.com/remote/">Remote</a>.
I had read a couple things about them previously and seeing as I want to run my
own business in the near future I though it would be advantageous to pick up a
few books. Thing is, I&#8217;ve never particularly agreed with the model that most
business take. Startups bother me because I dislike the idea of having to rely
on someone else&#8217;s money and give them control over something I&#8217;m building.
Especially if their concern is making a profit instead of just building
something for the sake of building it. I enjoy being of the school of thought
that building something great and not worrying so much about the money will lead
to a path filled with both.</p>

<p>Small businesses usually aren&#8217;t profitable and don&#8217;t have the kind of impact I&#8217;m
looking to have on the world. Their reach is limited, and the term implies
adjective small implies there is a core difference between them and a business.
Turns out I&#8217;m not crazy. 37Signals is the type of company I want to run. They&#8217;re
small, but certainly not a small business. They have less than 100 employees yet
they have built and maintain products that are used by hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really care about money. Obviously we all need it to survive in this
world. I just don&#8217;t consider it the focus of my work. I&#8217;ve written it many times
that I just want to build things, and that still rings true. I want to model my
business after that as well..</p>

<h1>What&#8217;s Wrong With Planning?</h1>

<p>That said, what&#8217;s wrong with planning then? Well, the first problem is the same
one I&#8217;ve seen over and over again: planning leads to planning which leads to
more plans to plan out more planning to plan the next plan. Obviously all
planning isn&#8217;t evil, and some amount of planning is worth it, but nothing is
better than getting down and getting some work done.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s another disadvantage to planning, it&#8217;s completely based on guessing.
Generally, we aren&#8217;t good at guessing. Let&#8217;s say we want to see if the 50/50
statistic of flipping a coin is accurate. To test this idea, most people would
just start flipping coins until they reach some number of flips, say 100. Now if
we plug this problem into the planning machine, you wind up with attempting to
figure out the actual probability of heads versus tails. You can take into
account the type of coin used, the wind speed that day, how humid the air is,
and a whole slew of other things. Or we could just start flipping coins. 100
flips won&#8217;t take more than a few minutes and produces results. Doing all those
calculations, even with the help of modern computing will take hours if not
days.</p>

<p>I realize this is a simple comparison, but as I&#8217;ve said before good complexity
is formed from simplicity. Complex tasks can usually be broken down into a
series of simple tasks, that could even be as simple as the coin flipping
experiment. We spend too much time planning and not enough time trying. Back
when it took a day to compile things or even a few hours to compiling a program
it made sense. Now it takes seconds to compile or even less.</p>

<h1>Writing Things Down</h1>

<p>Planning things involves writing things down, as does documenting progress.
Documentation is especially important. Like planning, I don&#8217;t think explicit
documentation is the best for most circumstances. There is value in being able
to implicitly understand what something is doing.</p>

<p>A form of writing I often do in my code is commenting. I&#8217;m a bit torn over
whether this is actually the best way to go about things. When I go to write a
story, I usually write an outline down that specifies the events that are going
to occur, maybe sketch out the characters and locations, and flush out the plot
line. That&#8217;s great, but when I go and actually write the story I don&#8217;t write
down extra information to describe what&#8217;s going on in the story. That wouldn&#8217;t
make sense.</p>

<p>Similarly, when I&#8217;m surfing the web, I don&#8217;t need to pull up a separate
document that describes what I&#8217;m viewing or how I should interact with the page.
I just start navigating around and the information in the page tells me where to
go. Code is another language, and while sometimes it is necessary to have
additional information to understand parts of it (just like you need a
dictionary for other languages), verbose commenting of everything seems
excessive. The understanding of what is occurring in the code should be implicit.
Of course providing explicit documentation for the API that is exposed makes
sense. Similarly, explaining the jargon of a specific field is also necessary.</p>

<p>This leads me to another point of contention I have with APIs of the RESTful
variety. I&#8217;ve recently started reading <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028468.do">RESTful Web
APIs</a> and it&#8217;s started making
me question why we build our APIs so that they require someone to read
documentation before they can use it. The web as a platform doesn&#8217;t have this
requirement and a vast amount of the information on it doesn&#8217;t require this type
of information to be conveyed externally before a service can be used.</p>
